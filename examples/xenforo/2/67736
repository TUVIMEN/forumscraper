That being said i *DO* understand both sides.... I understand why Linda is upset, honestly i do. But for me, if the patent is legal... then why should MOE feel guilty about enforcing it when it comes down to threatening her business? Isnt that WHY people spend the money to get patented? Isnt that the inventors right? Yes she is a WAHM, but she is also a business owner and you have to do whats right for YOUR business.... Yes it would hurt Happy Heinys business to go back to retail only... but it isnt MOE&#039;s fault that she ventured in that direction... maybe it would have been a wise decision to talk to Tereson BEFORE taking that step ? That would have saved all this hassle.... FuzziBunz have said patent pending for a long time.. and the application has been in the database for a long time.. so there was no question that it probably WOULD happen down the road.. kwim? It seems that IF *I* were running a pocket diaper business I would cover my bases and contact anyone with patents pending to see exactly what i would be infringing or not infringing on. So I guess i just cant see fault in MOE using their legal right to protect their design... because Tereson is right.. IF she were allow Happy Heinys to continue wholesaling/distributing.... then she would have no basis to protect her design from someone else down the line doing the same thing (WAHM or NON WAHM).",

Firstly, it would have seemed better business practice for MOE to notice that HH are popular, and expanding, and wonder why. Perhaps its the difference in style, with aplix closures, or the prints, or the fact that the quality is currently better. (I say this as a FB user. I like the product, but am frustrated by the poor quality of the diapers - losing snaps after just a few weeks, terrible pilling in some diapers but not in others, proving that it is not my laundry or care that is the problem, but MOE&#039;s quality control <div class=\" lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-9-1736169442\" data-lb-id=\"attachment_xfUid-9-1736169442\" style=\"\"> <div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-9-1736169442\" data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/angry.gif\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div> <picture> <img data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/angry.gif\" class=\"bbImage lazyload\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" data-url=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/angry.gif\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"\" style=\"\" /> <div class=\" shimmer animate \" style=\"width: min(100%, px);\"></div> </picture> </div> )<br /> <br /> MOE could have taken a very different line over this patent. Eg, setting their own house in order, by sorting out their quality control, and maybe employing someone to trim off all those loose threads that come with their brand new diapers LOL. Then maybe looking at why HH are getting increasingly popular. Maybe offering some prints and a style with aplix closures.<br /> <br /> I&#039;m not a fan of aplix, but having experienced FBs current poor quality, and watched the recent discussions here, I&quot;m tempted to try out HH while they are still available.<br /> <br /> I have a lot of work that is copyrighted and trademarked. I watch carefully what other people do with my material, and make regular web searches for that purpose. Invariably, I let things go, even though my work has been used without permission many, many times. I use what people do with my work to inform me, and see imitation as a form of flattery. I am pleased that what I have done has had an impact on others. There is enough work for us all, and I need to be one of the best, in order to deserve my market share. Sometimes I need to see what others are doing in order to get a kick in the pants.<br /> <br /> Ideally, for the consumer, MOE will take this as a kick in the pants and get their quality sorted out. Ideally, they will bring out some alternatives, to compete with companies like HH. The competition will continue to flourish. There will be more choice, and more diversity. More people will be converted to use cloth diapers, when they see the wonderful pocket diapers that are available (without loose threads and snaps that don&#039;t snap, maybe <div class=\" lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-10-1736169442\" data-lb-id=\"attachment_xfUid-10-1736169442\" style=\"\"> <div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-10-1736169442\" data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/smile.gif\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div> <picture> <img data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/smile.gif\" class=\"bbImage lazyload\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" data-url=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"\" style=\"\" /> <div class=\" shimmer animate \" style=\"width: min(100%, px);\"></div> </picture> </div> )<br /> <br /> If just a tiny % of the disposable diaper users were converted, there would be enough business for MOE, HH, and a whole host of others.<br /> <br /> Diapering Utopia, I suppose...................... <div class=\" lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-11-1736169442\" data-lb-id=\"attachment_xfUid-11-1736169442\" style=\"\"> <div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-attachment_xfUid-11-1736169442\" data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/hippie.gif\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div> <picture> <img data-src=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/hippie.gif\" class=\"bbImage lazyload\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" data-url=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/images/smilies/hippie.gif\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"\" style=\"\" /> <div class=\" shimmer animate \" style=\"width: min(100%, px);\"></div> </picture> </div>",

I thought that it just has to be shown that somewhere on planet there existed such an item prior to the development of the patented product. So if someone can prove that a pocket dipe existed prior to, say, 1999, then the new patent is voided. Can any patent-experts can confirm or deny my understanding of this??<br /> <br /> Second, from what Linda stated <a href=\"http://216.92.20.151/discussions/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=67212\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">here</a> the patent really only covers the exact style that Tereson patented.

She says that she isn&#039;t going after WAHMs, then follows with she will go after them if they don&#039;t get a license from her. She says that she isn&#039;t trying to put WAHMs out of business, then follows with a threat to shut them down if their business is making diapers and then distributing them through retailers. To me, she is telling them that they won&#039;t be shut down, but only as long as they do things her way.<br /> <br /> I understand protecting your patent...completely understand wanting to protect it. However, a lot of statements made seem downright deceptive and that is what really bothers me. If you are going to go after other WAHMs, just do it...be forthright and honest about it.

There&#039;s something about the whole thing that leaves a very bad taste in my mouth: MOE&#039;s statements about &quot;I know how hard it is to be a WAHM, I want to support them, blah blah blah&quot; makes it all sound warm and fuzzy until you get to the point of other WAHMs following in her footsteps to become something more than a one-mom operation. To me it sounds like &quot;you all can have your little businesses, but don&#039;t try to make it bigger like I did - you can&#039;t go there.&quot;<br /> <br /> And I say this as someone who likes FBs and hasn&#039;t had the huge problems with them that other people have, and I also appreciate the fact that MOE is providing a product for lots of retail WAHMs to sell. I just think MOE&#039;s energies would be better spent a) getting the QC thing under control, and b) going after a larger share of the sposie using market, not attacking other WAHMs. Let&#039;s face it, as these boards demonstrate, there&#039;s a huge untapped market out there, with room IMO for lots more WAHMs/cloth diaper companies!",

That includes Linda and Tereson. I feel put in the middle as a consumer and as a retailer. Whose diaper do I choose? Who&#039;s side am I on?<br /> <br /> I personally think that the patent of FB was a bad idea b/c it created a FB vs. the rest of the pocket diapering community scenario. I mean, it really should be the cloth diapering community trying to convert the sposie community. Also, and i really don&#039;t mean this to judge, I think it was really done poorly. I agree that the whole part about changing the insert while the dipe is still on the baby is ridiculous, in fact, one of the reasons I started using FBs was to see if there was a way that I could possibly do that. There isn&#039;t, unless the opening goes on the bottom as well. Also, I think it&#039;s gross not to change them each time or at least give each one a break in between so the pee can dry out and any bacteria will die. Anyway, back to the patent, the diagrams shown are in the rounded tab style, which she doesn&#039;t use anymore, and there is a big contrversy surrounding the prior art section. I think that Tereson got some not so hot legal advice about the patent in general, how it would work for her, kwim?<br /> <br /> Then I think she got really bad advice in deciding to tell Linda that if she didn&#039;t get a license she would issue a C&amp;D, b/c it has only meant bad publicity for FB since then. That isn&#039;t good for Tereson or the WAHMs who retail FBs and puts us in a really precarious situation. I mean, when the diapering community gets cranky at a diaper, watch out!! So here she is, with thousands of dollars invested in a patent that probaby wasn&#039;t worth it, and so she is out a ton of money and if she tries to enforce the patent, everyone will hate her. I think she ended up in a lose/lose situation. I feel a lot of sympathy for her b/c I think she is a lot like me and any other WAHM, we&#039;re not these business savvy, cutthroat corporate kind of people, and so I think she really kind of got dragged into this by the lawyers and advisors she pays to <i>help</i> her with her biz. What they don&#039;t know is how the cloth diapering community works, kwim? Anyway, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to just judge her as being the worst example of a greedy company gone bad.<br /> <br /> That said, I think Linda and HHs are really big victims here. She is a WAHM who makes an awesome product. Did she come up with it after hearing/trying FBs? Yeah, sure, but that deosn&#039;t mean it the same product. It has a different style and cut, different tabs and aplix instead of snaps, as well as tons of different prints. No matter how much she starts wholesaling her product, it is still sewn at home, whether by her or her henchwomen and hand sorted by her dd who is rewarded with chocloate syrup. I just don&#039;t think she is a huge threat to FB. Her diapers are different. I think it is SO important to have options like that. Hell, I&#039;ve been accused of being a commie, but darn it, I want competition so we can all get the product that is right for us.<br /> <br /> I don&#039;t know what the outcome of this will be. i have heard that Tereson decided not to pursue HHs and i have heard she will continue to pursue a licensing deal. I think that maybe FBs should stop pursuing a licensing deal wtih HHs and then develop a pattern for WAHMs like HoneyBoy and have WAHMs make them. They will prove that they are dedicated to the WAHM, support WAHMs and then they will be able to offer some awesome prints. They can still mass produce their dipes and have a licensing deal with the WAHMs who make the WAHM version of FB. There are so many ways MOE can market, I really think that it would be more profitable to pursue other options.<br /> <br /> I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll think of more things to say, I guess I&#039;m just babbling on and on. It just sucks b/c I have never had a bad dealing with Linda or Tereson, and I think they are both dedicated to their businesses. I would rather they worked this out without lawyers and letters and stuff. I think the HHs and FBs compliment each other. I also think that FBs should start offering the all fleece diaper again. Like, have the PUL and the fleece version. But htat is a thread for diapering.
