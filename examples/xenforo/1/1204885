Hoping some of you with experience can help guide me.<br/>I like wide a varied genres of music and my setup works well for me on all but intense/busy metal, thrash and indie rock.<br/><br/>I’m not enjoying listening to the likes of Metallica, Stereophonics, Blink 182, Chilli’s etc.<br/>Essentially the busy barrage of mid/high frequency stuff just sounds unorganised and painful.<br/><br/>My setup is;<br/>NAD C545BEE player,<br/>Arcam irDAC,<br/>Yamaha AVR V-RX667,<br/>B&amp;W 684s<br/><br/>Room is 6.0M x 4.5M, speakers are up one end, about 1.2M off the end wall and 0.5M in.<br/>All other music sounds great, spent a lot of time playing with the positions.<br/><br/>Is the cause for this poor sound arrangement from the amp?<br/>It should be getting good input from the NAD and/or DAC, again all other music is great.<br/>Should I get a dedicated stereo amp, and if so what is recommended for the crashing onslaught of metal?<br/><br/>Also could it be the likes of Blink 182 for example just are not well mastered in the first place?<br/><br/>Any input much appreciated<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

Also for blink their self titled is probably the best recorded of the lot and still a little rough. <br/><br/>To help with these genres you might try playing around with some of the yammies dsp settings or at least boost the bass.

They are good for video and audio processing into a surround system. If you want great 2 channel sound, you need a dedicated 2 channel system. Revelation came last year when I built the man cave system around my two restored vintage receivers. When my very expensive Rotel AVR died after 12 years of daily service, I did a little research and knew that I was not gonna invest that kind of cash in an AVR again. So I got a good AVR and an excellent stereo pre-amp.<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

An AVR is gonna “process” no matter what mode is selected. Straight up stereo gear will not. For example the default mode in my new Rotel Preamp is Bypass. This means straight pass through of source as do my vintage receivers. It and they sound amazing. While my very expensive class D Rotel AVR had a great power supply and on board amplifiers, the pre out or different modes were still being processed. I could hear the difference immediately.<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

In many cases plenty of that music was well-recorded and even mastered well for the time. Where things often go wrong is with remasters of said 90s material from the 2000s and later. Often those are completely crushed in terms of dynamic range and if you only stream music you are stuck with whatever you get on the platform. <br/><br/>I would take a good look at the listening room and try to get some kind of analysis on the room acoustics. <br/><br/>Switching amps may not completely solve all of your issues. Sounds like you have a few different things going on and you&#039;re going to have to isolate variables one by one and deal with them. You don&#039;t show a picture of how your equipment is set up or what the room looks like. Even a simple diagram of this and more info on the room would help people make practical suggestions for you. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend ignoring the recommendations to buy a vintage 70s receiver. Those things are getting very old at this point (aging out of spec components) and most of them are going to sound like mud if they haven&#039;t been serviced (I&#039;ve heard a bunch). It will be easier and much less of a hassle to simply buy a reliable new amp with adequate power for your speakers. You&#039;ll probably get better sound as well.<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

I doubt the crest factor of that blink track is taxing your avr. Why not use a power calculator to determine how much power you need. You can find them at crown or benchmark websites or just do it yourself knowing listening distance, desired spl, crest factor of recording and speaker sensitivity.<br/><br/>At 75 db you probably are not using more than a watt or two; more likely fractions of a watt. If I were you, I’d borrow some separates and an integrated to test things out. I really doubt it will make much difference with what you are describing. My bet is on recordings or speakers being the issue. Another test would be to use some known excellent recordings in the metal genre like rage against the machine or tool. Green Day American Idiot is a good one for rock. There are many others, just some suggestions off the top of my head. Good luck <img src=\"images/smilies/orangesmile.gif\" class=\"mceSmilie\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smilie    :)\" /><br/><br/>For transparency, I actually use a bottom of the line yammy avr in my tv room with my Falcons. I listen to that system way more than my main system that has nice separates.<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

Low efficiency speakers will always reveal the inadequacy of whatever amplifier you have playing. I have a set of tad 2402 clones now with tad drivers that will get up and go when I want it but more importantly as my senior hearing is growing more limited they have a very seductive dynamic presentation that with the classical contemporary music I mostly listen to now is really gratifying. I really rarely post anymore but this particular topic is one that is near and dear to me.

Usually whatever the manufacturer recommends you can divide by 2 so long as the amplifier is not a train wreck - and Rotel is generally better than their price points (Ie good bang for the buck)<br/><br/>B&amp;W owns Rotel - so in theory, it should be a decent match - if you feel you need more power - buy a Rotel RB 1070 power amp on the second-hand market - Check to make sure your A11 has Preouts on the back. It likely does - if it does then you can turn your Rotel into a preamp - connect the RB 1070 up and use this as your power amp (130 watts per channel) and you will now have &quot;separates.&quot; This should provide a &quot;cleaner&quot; and more powerful sound. Of course, you do not have to stick to Rotel for a secondhand power amp - you may find less expensive and just as powerful options.</div><div class=\"quoteExpand\">Click to expand...</div></blockquote></aside></div>This series of speakers are hard load for amplifier.

Most Solid State companies do because there is nothing that&#039;s really changed over the years. The RB 1070 is 130 watts per channel - so is the RB 1552. You could also go with the 1582 or the 1590 for the same look (but bigger and with much more power). I owned the RC 1082 preamp and still own the RB 1050 Power amp.<br/><br/>It is quite possible to buy a second-hand Rotel Preamp and Power amp combination from an older series like my combination above for less money than just one of the two components of a modern series (that may be largely identical in sound quality).<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

Or for that matter a speakers with 4 such woofers on top of each other.<br/><br/>You&#039;ll get excellent results from something like this: $1,798/pair 2X15 inch woofers per side.<br/><br/><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbggpCYBuUc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>The problem is the stereo magazine reviewers try to push all kinds of dynamically inept small standmounts which are fine because they may offer more magic with Diana Krall - and that&#039;s what those reviewers listen to 98% of the time. At the end of the day, it&#039;s perfectly fine to buy speakers that are best suited for your taste and the music you listen to and the Cerwin Vegas above are simply going to do metal and hard rock better than a KEF, PMC or Wilson or any other speaker using one 6 inch woofer no matter how much the speaker is priced. The CV will hit you in the chest - the LS-50 won&#039;t.

Even the best, most coherent-sounding piece of metal is a mess to me, music-wise.

Id also put a multimeter on em to confirm continuity and ohm rating. Personally unless they come from a vintage dealer who has a shop, I’m gun shy. The woofers are alway gonna be brittle.

Especially hard rock / heavy metal / any kind of loud music using a lot of instruments and especially new „hot masterings“. What used to sound undefined and rather hard to listen to, got way nicer and more musical to listen to. The newer („hotter“) the masterings, the more the effect! It sounds like music, clarity of the single intruments got impressive! Even better when I finally upgraded to Luxman C &amp; M 10x. So in my experience it has nothing to do with watts but with the way the power is transformed or whatever happens to the power inside the device. (C / M 900 and C / M 10x have the same specs of Watts!) I am not an engineer, so I am unable to explain exactly technically what improved the sound, sorry. Hope it helps…<br/>I used to listen to music using an AVR, too. Any used stereo amplifier improved sound quality a lot, independent its pricing.

My speakers, Nautilus 804’s (not 804 Diamond), don’t have an aggressive top end sound, I’ve had my N 804’s for more than 25 years and the top end has never been a problem. I’m a metal head from the beginning and have hundreds of metal records in my collection and a lot of them are actually very good sounding. IMO it’s impossible to claim that all metal sounds terrible on any system.<div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

I see you have no avatar, nor information. I would also direct you to the admonition from our host that you not opine on equipment you have not owned. What matters is how speakers sound with my gear and my room. I listen to actual music vs sensor data on a computer screen. Telling a member that his experience is somehow not legit because data from some audio rag says otherwise is pretty cheeky.
