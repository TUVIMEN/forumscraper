Back when it aired I wanted to record it, but I did not have a dvd recorder or a vhs recorder at the time, so I thought like many original tv series that it would air again but it never did so I was mad. I heard that a new series was being filmed, but I&#039;m not sure. Does anyone know if it&#039;s coming back? <div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div> </blockquote>"

It&#039;s season 1, 13 episodes. <div class=\"messageTextEndMarker\">&nbsp;</div> </blockquote>"
