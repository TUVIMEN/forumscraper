It might be different now, but at the time a candidate went through several interviews, two weeks of paid trial, more interviews, two weeks of waiting for an answer, and little feedback the whole time. So for me, that would mean at least a month of stress and unresolved anxiety. :) Lots of people on glassdoor describe the CEO as &quot;mercurial.&quot;<p>But anyway, things I liked about the company are that they tend to work with mature technology stacks (e.g. probably a culture of iterative improvement vs teardown-and-rebuild) and that all engineers start out doing three weeks of helpdesk. That should be more common in the industry."

I’m certainly not defending it.<p>Since we’re on a site run by YC, I should note that a version of the same “record a video” requirement is part of the standard YC application, with some of the same downsides for equitable venture capital investment decisions. Of course, a big difference is that venture capital investment decisions are entirely outside of the scope of discrimination law as currently enacted everywhere I know of, despite being very close in effect and power dynamics to hiring decisions in an employment context."

To be clear, my suggested requirement is that the visuals in the video must support the content but that the video must not depict the appearance of the applicant.<p>In the hypothetical alternate reality where one can trust that applicants would not represent the work of someone else or of generative AI as their own, I would also encourage replacing the audio with text to speech, so as to reduce the risk of discrimination based on the perceived gender or the particular accent of the applicant. Unfortunately, I don’t think one can trust arbitrary applicants to be that honest, so the ability to recognize the voice from the video in subsequent interviews still provides some useful authentication value.

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code> * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently). * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc. * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense. * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on. </code></pre> We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. (That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.)

We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety&#x2F;compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.<p>We&#x27;ve just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w&#x2F; cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).<p>In addition, we&#x27;ve started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we&#x27;re excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.<p>[ Role ] We&#x27;re looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI&#x2F;UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we&#x27;re building the right features and providing value. If you&#x27;re an individual that doesn&#x27;t want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.<p>MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.<p>[ Stack ] MobileOps&#x27; BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there&#x27;s a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.<p>If you’re interested you can email: jobs@ company domain. Please paste your CV (no attachments) and provide some information about yourself and work experience. Feel free to ask questions as well."

But, if you are interested in our stack, we use Svelte for the frontend, manage our own k8s cluster for both CPU-based containers or GPU ones, and use PostgreSQL for our database. we are still exploring different technologies regarding scaling such as horizontally scalable key-val stores. and, while we are not afraid of technology migrations or newer technology, we prefer to err on the side of speed while converging towards simplicity (e.g. hacking something together to put it in front of users and then slowly removing 3rd-party vendors of libraries once we have proven the product feature works).<p>on applied researchers: we evaluate candidates based on their intuitions around the state-of-the-art in the use of AI for creative applications. this usually involves a few publications at top-conferences (ICML, CVPR, NeurIPS, ...), but it is technically not required since we think many of the best applied researchers are often self-taught and even found outside traditional research institutions.<p>* Why now?<p>We have been growing consistently in terms of recurring revenue, we have many world-class backers (e.g. founder of Facebook AI Research), and there is significantly more equity upside than elsewhere as of now -- especially since our current team is smaller than competitors. Our burn rate is exceptionally low, the amount of per-engineer impact is big (measured, for example, in millions-of-users &#x2F; employee is probably among the top in our sector), and our financials are great. We can disclose more details in a call.<p>If this sounds enticing to you, email me at `d at krea dot ai`"

That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve built and launched in above universities (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;</a>). We have a 12 year roadmap! it&#x27;s a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.<p>Note on team&#x2F;compensation: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it! Our pay is commensurate in the 60-70th percentile of the market, and we add-on meaningful equity. We plan for a 4 year path of growth for every individual in our team.

The team you&#x27;ll be joining is full of expert engineers, and well known people in the Elixir community. You might have used their work already.<p>Our second role is an social media and community representative. We are creating a new category of tooling in a giant industry and we need your help to tell the story. The ideal candidate will have experience building a community around a grand vision, while being grounded in our customers&#x27; successes and our team&#x27;s ability to ship.<p>We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A.
