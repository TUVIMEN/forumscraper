We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.</code></pre>We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. (That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.)

We need our first marketer, which is a big ownership opportunity. Seperately, as our DC gov side is especially growing, also on-site data scientists &amp; data eng for cleared mission work at public trust &#x2F; secret &#x2F; top secret.<p>Louie.AI is our expansion to making investigations even easier via generative AI UX and real-time AI KG (eg, real-time graph RAG). We are already launching with banks, govs, tech co&#x27;s, etc. Complimenting Louie.AI&#x27;s current self-hosted version, we are looking for a fullstack engineer to help drive our SaaS launch&#x27;s multitenancy scaling work. The growth marketing is about the launch of louie.ai as an easier entrypoint into graph for key domains.<p>We have options both contractor, contract-to-hire, and full time:<p>- The DC data roles are onsite reporting to leadership at a top enforcement agency, where we are expanding from 1 person to 3. One data engineering &amp; analytics, the other data science &amp; analytics, with emphasis on LLM (llama 3.1 400b), graph, and GPUs for crime analytics. Very mission oriented.<p>- The growth marketing is global remote, US timezone preferred, with overlap with a team 70% in the Americas (US, Canada, South America) and 30% elsewhere (Norway, ...). Marketing benefits for understanding technical markets (cyber, ...), category creation, and hands-on.<p>- The fullstack role is also global remote, with US time zones preferred. Initially to tackle vertically &amp; horizontally scaling the SaaS: typed python, redis, docker, react, vector databases, GPU infra, open telemetry, etc. Later, optionally continuing on to ECS&#x2F;k8s, similar to the rest of our gpu infra, or push more on pure fullstack side. Fullstack is interesting here as it&#x27;s similar to notebook-as-a-service and orchestration on the backend, and a highly immersive &amp; interactive analytics environment on the frontend, with GPU &amp; AI services all around.<p>See careers page and send an email based on what is there - we are actively growing to meet customer need, so it is an exciting time!"

But, if you are interested in our stack, we use Svelte for the frontend, manage our own k8s cluster for both CPU-based containers or GPU ones, and use PostgreSQL for our database. we are still exploring different technologies regarding scaling such as horizontally scalable key-val stores. and, while we are not afraid of technology migrations or newer technology, we prefer to err on the side of speed while converging towards simplicity (e.g. hacking something together to put it in front of users and then slowly removing 3rd-party vendors of libraries once we have proven the product feature works).<p>on applied researchers: we evaluate candidates based on their intuitions around the state-of-the-art in the use of AI for creative applications. this usually involves a few publications at top-conferences (ICML, CVPR, NeurIPS, ...), but it is technically not required since we think many of the best applied researchers are often self-taught and even found outside traditional research institutions.<p>* Why now?<p>We have been growing consistently in terms of recurring revenue, we have many world-class backers (e.g. founder of Facebook AI Research), and there is significantly more equity upside than elsewhere as of now -- especially since our current team is smaller than competitors. Our burn rate is exceptionally low, the amount of per-engineer impact is big (measured, for example, in millions-of-users &#x2F; employee is probably among the top in our sector), and our financials are great. We can disclose more details in a call.<p>If this sounds enticing to you, email me at `d at krea dot ai`"

This involves everything from serverless computing to optimizing end-to-end cloud workflows. It helps if you spent a few years grinding out C++. We are specifically looking for people who have front-end experience to help fill team gaps.<p>Also, if you are not super skilled at cloud infra, but are a steely-eyed computer engineer who has GPU accelerated your cat, feel free to apply to one of the roles as well.

My experience is 10+ years of SWE, most recently at FAANG. After that, I co-founded a venture backed startup as CTO.<p>The areas I am currently prospecting are:<p>1. AI for Human Resources Vertical SAAS.<p>The area is ripe for disruption, and I believe that in the coming decade a significant percentage of HR, particularly recruiting, will be automated. I have a few specific ideas I want to run down.<p>As for more about who I am looking for:<p>1. You are extremely technical across a number of areas: Front End, Cloud, AWS, Back End, Java, Typescript, Python, streaming, NextJS, agentic workflows.<p>2. You want to play a non-technical role in the beginning.<p>Distribution is everything, and so while I am a programmer at heart, I will spend the next few months prospecting the market, and attempting to sell different HR solutions into different vertical markets. I want to make a science out of testing the market, and then quickly execute on the technical product.<p>If this interests you, reachout!<p>I can be reached at ycapplicants@gmail.com"

I have been experimenting with GenAI especially LLMs, but also a few text2voice, voice2text, text2img, and image2text.   My area and interest of research is an AI augmented OS and AI agents powered by LLMs.  I&#x27;m looking to get some help to clear out my never ending backlog.<p>You will be working with me to develop lots of little blocks&#x2F;primitives which will be used to build a more complete tool set and running various LLM experiments to push and bend LLM far beyond what most people think is possible.<p>You need to to be willing to listen and learn.  To have an open mind in trying new things, failing and trying again.  1+ years of experience in python programming or ReactJS frontend development.   Some experience with git and database.   Experience with RESTful API.  Hungry to learn.<p>This might be for you, if you wish to have fun with LLM&#x2F;AI, wish to be mentored and growing your coding skills.   Build possibly cool stuff.  Flexibility, part time, timezone, if you have other obligations (job, school).<p>Send me an email showcasing what you have done especially if anything with LLMs, Restful API with python or React app. I&#x27;m happy to checkout github repo or emailed code.
