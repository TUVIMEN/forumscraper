A situation in which a single individual holds all the power and permits bureaucrats like ICE to do what they wanted to any individual for any reason with noone else being able to intervene would <i>also</i> be a republic with limited democratic participation in the decision making process, though not one I would prefer, particularly not if I was a law-abiding citizen who understood how legal processes worked but had the sort of ancestry ICE and Trump seem a bit suspicious of...<p>No systems in the US look like what people campaigned on and voted for. What would policy look like in with true public votes on anything and everything? Well judging by approval ratings, Trump&#x27;s decision to singlehandedly cause a recession with his tariff policy is something the public overall do <i>not</i> back, no matter how much Trump claims that he&#x27;s acting for them and against globalist elites. Similarly, it seems that what Trump&#x27;s newly created bureaucracy is doing to other government departments doesn&#x27;t meet with wide approval, no matter how much the world&#x27;s richest man appointed to head after giving him lots of money it claims to be tackling elites and corruption. Trump is a populist, but like many other populists he and many of his actions are not at all <i>popular</i> at the moment: it&#x27;s a feature of the design of republics rather than the popular will that he remains in power nevertheless. Perhaps that&#x27;s why the executive&#x27;s power is supposed to be checked...<p>But yes, the one area in which his approval ratings stayed above water in <i>some</i> polls is in his handling of immigration. Whether this includes every decision the unelected bureaucracy that is ICE makes to select random non-citizens and citizens for detention or even deportation to to foreign concentration camps for wrongthink or wrong tattoos is another question; seems like public opinion sides with the courts rather than the admin on deporting a legal immigrant for no reason and then not bringing him back because that would mean admitting error. In a republic like the US it&#x27;s actually <i>not</i> the job of the official elected in the belief he&#x27;d get the price of eggs down to overrule courts, and it seems hollow to claim it&#x27;d be more democratic to skip the process of legislative change in favour of executive fiat when the public doesn&#x27;t agree with him on many of the details.<p>It would, of course, technically be more democratic to have people&#x27;s right to remain in the country based not upon law but upon the prevailing fashionability of their skin colour and surname with a wider public that got to vote on mass deportations to third countries whenever they felt like it. Even as someone with reason to be completely confident this wouldn&#x27;t jeopardise my right to remain in the country I was born in, I&#x27;d hesitate to say that supplanting citizenship law with a public popularity contest would be <i>better</i> though it would be more democratic. But this has nothing to do with what is going on in the US, which involves the president insisting his his yuge popular mandate places him so far above the law that bureaucrats whose actions he favours don&#x27;t have to follow it, never mind other populists like Maduro or Mao or Mussolini who didn&#x27;t even worry too much about the mandate bit."

But I saw little effort to look at the “emanations from penumbras” of the INA, which is a decidedly pro-deportation document.<p>And some of the actions have been simply lawless. For example, after the Supreme Court ruled that Judge Boasberg lacked jurisdiction in the deportation flights case, the proper course would have been to dismiss. Instead, he initiated contempt proceedings based on failure to follow an order that was void <i>ab initio</i>, citing case law that applies to private litigants but makes no sense in a case where a district court exceeds its jurisdiction to compel a co-equal branch of government to act. Sanity prevailed and the DC Circuit administratively stayed those contempt proceedings. Judge Howell, in one of the law firm EO cases, asserted that firms had a first amendment right to pursue “progressive employment policies”—even though the first amendment obviously doesn’t apply to race-conscious employment policies. Other courts are insisting that Trump can’t revoke temporary authorizations by executive fiat that Biden granted by executive fiat.<p>More generally, courts are abusing their injunction powers. Read <i>Marbury v. Madison</i> again. The court goes out of its way to avoid enjoining the secretary of state even to perform the “ministerial” task of delivering a letter the president had already signed. <i>Marbury</i> makes clear that, while courts have the power to declare the law, and overturn Congress’s laws, its power to compel the executive branch to act is extremely limited.<p>The Supreme Court correctly ruled in the deportation flights case that the administration must allow detainees to file habeas petitions in the districts where they’re detained. That’s a proper exercise of district courts’ jurisdiction to adjudicate alleged deprivations of <i>individual</i> rights. It’s not proper for the courts to try and use that authority to enjoin entire executive policies that offend a judge’s sensibilities."

He also interpreted the law in ways that were not “faithful” to Congressional intent. For example, he took a law that allows parole on a “case-by-case” basis, and gave blanket parole to hundreds of thousands. But then judges will say that these blanket protections must be revoked on a “case by case” basis.<p>People are prattling on about the Impoundment Act and whether Trump has statutory authority to reorganize executive departments. Meanwhile, Obama created an entire amnesty program (DACA) nowhere in the INA, after failing to get the same amnesty through Congress.

I think there was an intentional plan to open the border and it wasn&#x27;t a charitable cause. I think we both know the purpose was ultimately to change the voter base to be more favorable, among other reasons. If that isn&#x27;t an authoritarian power move, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>Now regarding Kilmar, probably yes his rights were violated as happens routinely. I am not sure I am going to lose sleep over it because millions of people came here in one of the largest human migration events in history and we&#x27;re still at this point where we can&#x27;t talk about that but instead we debate about whether this clerical error was the event that turned us into a fascist dictatorship. I think it&#x27;s all disingenuous. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a term for it in the law but our country created an extraordinary legal situation and there&#x27;s bound to be mistakes made and I think significant political bias is present among judges and lawyers in what should be a neutral court. Do they really care about rights or is this more about keeping immigrants here at any cost?<p>Actually in 2018 Trump deported an elderly guy who may have had dementia who was accused of being a Nazi war criminal, his name was Jakiw Palij you can look it up. There wasn&#x27;t strong evidence he was evading war crimes though and he wasn&#x27;t accepted as a citizen anywhere in Europe because of border changes. I suspect his rights were violated in some way but no one cared for obvious reasons. None of the lawyers you see now jumped to defend this guy.

People may or may not like this or that incident in the moment, but that doesn’t mean they disapprove of the overall arc of the policy. So, for example, polls show that virtually no Trump voters regret their vote and he’d probably win a rematch: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emersoncollegepolling.com&#x2F;trump-100-days&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emersoncollegepolling.com&#x2F;trump-100-days&#x2F;</a> (Emerson is a good pollster, its final 2024 polls nailed Trump’s actual share, and overestimated Harris only by 2). Issue polls taken in the moment also suffer from response bias—e.g. people who approve of the overall arc of Trump’s immigration policy are less likely to respond to polling about a flub than people who are outraged by the policy itself. (The 2024 Harris bounce should be a good lesson in response bias!)<p>And a rule based on second guessing election results based on issue polling would never be applied even handedly—judges are definitionally elites and such a rule would be applied to favor their preferences. Issue polling showed the ACA under water for quite some time. Roberts had ample basis for finding the statute unconstitutional—far less of a stretch than the expansive interpretations of asylum laws—but he admirably saved it. And I’d argue that, contrary to the issue polls, Obamas’s reelection ultimately bore out that the ACA had a mandate."

It&#x27;s also a feature designed for practical implementation and less disruptive governance, but so is the separation of powers and rule of law (the &quot;anti-democratic&quot; separation of powers and rule of law having much stronger and more enduring support than actions of any individual president suggests that wasn&#x27;t a decision the Founding Fathers got wrong...). A rule based on letting the public decide exactly who got to stay in the country and who won each court case would obviously be more democratic than delegating that power to judges, but it would not function particularly well. A rule based on letting ICE elites rather than the judiciary rule on the rights and wrongs of particular immigration cases and giving the president the right to ignore people&#x27;s constitutional right to due process if they found it inconvenient would not be more democratic and would, I suspect, also not function very well. And suffice to say migration policy is not the only area where Trump is or was arguing that rules shouldn&#x27;t apply to him or that he should have more power.<p>Again, the difference between popular sovereignty and populism is quite well illustrated by your argument that if Trump&#x27;s deportation policy is underwater even in the poll you picked showing him with neutral favourability overall, the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; means that deportation decisions he approves and laws he chooses not to follow must be him enacting the will of the people, cheerfully disregarding details like the people explicitly wanting him to do something else and overwhelmingly endorsing the right of institutions ordering him to do something else to make those orders. The belief that the people should have some say in the decision making process is quite different from the belief that the people&#x27;s will is manifest in every action of some guy they elected on some issue that seemed salient."

Not for the better, I think.<p>Given how mediocre and even harmful public education in the US is, especially relative to its (now waning) superpower status, how large the US is, as well as the promotion of weird ideologies by the DoE, I cannot help but welcome its death. In general, I welcome to end of all sorts of vast educational bureaucracies, including those that have occupied private universities and drain them of resources without providing any justifiable benefit.<p>I think this is where people don&#x27;t grasp that we didn&#x27;t always have the kind of overbearing, cabinet-level department of education we have today. This really only goes back to the early 80s. Meaning, opposing the DoE isn&#x27;t the same as opposing education. The principle of subsidiarity ought to be respected. Decentralization is good. It should be liberating.<p>So, in practice, I anticipate a greater diversity of curricula. There already exist competing views on pedagogy. This would allow greater flexibility and educational liberty, but also the opportunity to observe how well various pedagogical approaches work. It also introduces a certain accountability, because while you can blame mediocrity on a distant DoE today, the responsibility for education will lie closer to home when there is no DoE to blame.<p>Incidentally, people like Feynman ostensibly lamented that he expected physics to stagnate given what he saw as the homogenization of education.

That&#x27;s what you get rid of when you argue for getting rid of the DoE. Why is this liberating?"

I’ve been actively involved in politics around precisely these kinds of issues, but of course you know better than me because it fits your own narrative about how your own country can’t also be going down the shitter."

This reeks of tribalism, not objective argument.<p>Because your comments are bad faith.<p>And I’ve addressed all your other nonsense already.<p>What you’re not grasping is the cultural differences between our two police forces.<p>In America, the police go relatively unchecked. They buy ex-military hardware, lie in interrogations, literally kill their own innocent citizens because of their skin colour, and at no point face any repercussions. So laws in the US need to be water tight to prevent abuse — and even then, they still get flouted by those who should be upholding them.<p>Whereas Europe have a hell of a lot more checks and balances for our police forces. Bad cops get struck off. Good cops cannot place charges without approval from a whole other department, and thus not emotionally connected to the case. If police lie or exaggerate in those reports then they’re up for a plethora of serious charges themselves. So UK law often feels more ripe for abuse but that’s because we have stronger processes in place to protect against abuse.<p>Coming back to your original point, you don’t know the seriousness of the comments shared. We’ve already given examples about how online comments can have real and damaging physical consequences. Such as organising riots. People in the US have been charged for doing just the same thing. In the UK the law is called “hate speech” but that’s doesn’t mean that people are being investigated just for saying “I hate x”. Just like how there are multiple different names for different types of reasons and severity of killing someone, “hate speech” is just a term that covers a wide plethora of circumstances. And if — and when — those “hate speech” laws are abused, the police are raked over the coals for overreach.<p>So when you claim “whataboutism” what’s actually happening is I’m demonstrating the cultural differences that you seem oblivious too.<p>When you claim “thought crimes” you’re completely missing the nuance in these cases.<p>And when you’re claiming the police are abusing their powers you’re being, at best, deeply ironic. At worst, deeply ignorant.<p>In fact this whole argument and your single mindedness can be entirely summed up as “deeply ignorant”.<p>So why do UK citizens defend this claim against “thought police”? Because it literally isn’t happening. It’s just some bullshit concocted by right wing media (the same people who talk about rigged elections, “out of control immigration” and other made up bullshit) and Americans who want to feel better about their own shitty police force."

They buy ex-military hardware, lie in interrogations, literally kill their own innocent citizens because of their skin colour, and at no point face any repercussions. So laws in the US need to be water tight to prevent abuse — and even then, they still get flouted by those who should be upholding them.<p>You&#x27;re generalizing a country far more than diverse than the UK here in terms of differences in smaller government reigons and their police forces. What you&#x27;ve said here is not universally true for the US by any means, just for certain states.<p>&gt; So UK law often feels more ripe for abuse but that’s because we have stronger processes in place to protect against abuse.<p>In this case, clearly not. The problem is not police abuse, it&#x27;s police showing up at all because someone didn&#x27;t want to shake hands or expressed a non-hateful thought on Twitter.<p>&gt; Coming back to your original point, you don’t know the seriousness of the comments shared.<p>We do, because the people that get harassed by the cops report them.<p>&gt; We’ve already given examples about how online comments can have real and damaging physical consequences.<p>Yes, they can, but that tends to be mobs or cyber bulling, outright insults. The cases that have been reported are not anything like that. If anything, it&#x27;s UK cops being used, manipulated and unwittingly used as weapons, which isn&#x27;t a much better look than if they are being malicious.<p>&gt; Such as organising riots. People in the US have been charged for doing just the same thing.<p>That doesn&#x27;t come under hate speech, but some other laws. Plenty of riots have nothing to do with hate speech, and the issue isn&#x27;t the same. There may be crossover sometimes, but not necessarily.<p>Therefore, people being arrested in the US for organizing riots is entirely irrelevant to what we are discussing.<p>&gt; In the UK the law is called “hate speech” but that’s doesn’t mean that people are being investigated just for saying “I hate x”.<p>Yes, it does, and that&#x27;s exactly the problem! There was literally an article in the Telegraph of that exact thing happening, twice!<p>How is this not blatant denial on your part?<p>&gt; So when you claim “whataboutism” what’s actually happening is I’m demonstrating the cultural differences that you seem oblivious too.<p>How incredibly disingenuous.<p>You mention cops killing black people, which has nothing to do with cultural differences unless you consider racism and lack of training in rural areas in red states cultural differences.<p>No, cultural differences is in no way a justification for your blatant whataboutism. A cop killing an unarmed black man in the US has NOTHING to do with cops showing up at peoples doors in the UK for sharing non hate thoughts online, holding up a blank piece of paper or refusing to shake hands. Honestly it&#x27;s a really crappy thing to try and reduce the killing of an innocent black man to any of those things just to try and save your crummy argument.<p>&gt; When you claim “thought crimes” you’re completely missing the nuance in these cases.<p>No, what&#x27;s happening here is you are giving the benefit of doubt to your government even when there are blatant examples that don&#x27;t warrant it. What is the nuance for the examples in the Telegraph article that would defend against the notion they were thought crimes?<p>&gt; And when you’re claiming the police are abusing their powers you’re being, at best, deeply ironic. At worst, deeply ignorant.<p>More insults. No, I&#x27;m being honest and objective, while you&#x27;re bending over backwards to be tribalistic like the worst examples of Americans, and then because you can&#x27;t actually support your point and I&#x27;m not conceding, resorting to insults and personal attacks.<p>You have no argument, and your attempts to defend your point trying to justify Orwellian actions in the UK by accusing me of cultural misunderstandings (which is funny since I bet I&#x27;ve spent more time in the UK than you&#x27;ve spent in the US) and and likening the UK incidents to the unarmed shooting of a black man are desperate and easily dismissed.<p>&gt; In fact this whole argument and your single mindedness can be entirely summed up as “deeply ignorant”.<p>NO, you&#x27;re simply being deeply arrogant and disingenuous. Your examples you&#x27;ve provided don&#x27;t map to the UK incidents, and when pressed you outwardly make excused to not provide them when asked, despite writing an essay to make the ridiculous argument you did above.<p>You keep accusing me of being ignorant, yet I&#x27;ve lived in the UK for about 5 years, how long did you spend in the US? And except the evidence supports my claims, while you need to reply on interpretations, speculation and bs claims of cultural misunderstandings.<p>&gt; So why do UK citizens defend this claim against “thought police”? Because it literally isn’t happening.<p>Some do, the patriots, others understand the issue and are out protesting against it fighting to keep or regain freedoms. That clearly isn&#x27;t you though. Why fight for an issue when you can deny it and whatbaoutism any attempt to point it out?"

Maybe one little police dept did, but it&#x27;s a systemic problem or seems to be.<p>&gt; It’s because of this court decision that your Google search turned up a Daily Mail article from 2019 and not something more recent!<p>I pasted the first result I found. I&#x27;m not interested in finding every. single. incident so you can dispute it one by one to keep trying to defend the UK. You either acknowledge there is an issue or you don&#x27;t, for me, the numerous incidents of this happening are a problem, not just isolated incidents being blown out of proportion. You clearly disagree.<p>&gt; You’ll have to remind me of the Chapter of 1984 in which the actions of the Thought Police are reined in by a system of legal checks and balances…<p>Heh. There were building blocks before Big Brother was introduced, and it was no accident the story was set in the UK either.<p>&gt; But it’s not a sinister Orwellian police state.<p>I never said it was. My claim was that it&#x27;s closer to being so than any other first world country. Downplaying cops acting as literal thought police (in that they are <i>literally</i> policing thoughts) is a problem and despite your assertion that your willing to be critical of the UK (which I don&#x27;t doubt but don&#x27;t tae as absolute), reads to me like being patriotic to the point of denying the issues being discussed."

I think that this has largely stopped following the court judgment that I mention downthread. I think there&#x27;s broad agreement here on what the police should and shouldn&#x27;t be doing. The issue is whether it&#x27;s actually accurate to paint a picture of the UK as a country where the police regularly harass people about their online postings. If people in the UK strike you as unduly unconcerned, consider the possibility that it&#x27;s because this isn&#x27;t actually happening to anything like the extent that some people on Twitter would like you to believe that it does.<p>By the way, you seem to be using &#x27;the government&#x27; in a very broad 90s internet libertarian sense. The police in the UK are operationally independent of the government of the day. As Wikipedia explains:<p>&gt; Police officers [in the UK] hold office and are not employees. Each officer is an independent legal official and not an &quot;agent of the police force, police authority or government&quot;. This allows the police their unique status and notionally provides the citizens of the UK a protection from any government that might wish unlawfully to use the police as an instrument against them."

Heroic feats of real-time planning have their place, and it&#x27;s great to have tools that help you with that, but routine can be covered with much simpler tools just as well.<p>Even in the Tokyo scenario you gave (which is fascinating -- thank you!) Google gives 30-40 min. for most public transit options, so for rough planning they&#x27;re all equivalent. Taxi is faster, and bicycle is almost at par."

What I4GL and its ilk accomplished was to make a passable bridge between SQL and a vanilla procedural programming language, which still had the usual SQL&#x2F;procedural impedance mismatches, but was miles ahead of horrors like Embedded SQL&#x2F;C (as you&#x27;ve alluded to with the remark about generated C&#x27;s verbosity.) I did my share of I4GL programming and still remember it semi-fondly."
