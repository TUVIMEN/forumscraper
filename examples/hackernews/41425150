  "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve built a Vue component library based on the GOV.UK Design System, which is used for government services in the UK. The Design System is well-known for being accessible, well designed and thoroughly researched, and it&#x27;s been used as the basis for many other governments&#x27; and organisations&#x27; design systems.<p>GOV.UK Vue includes every component in the GOV.UK Design System, with comprehensive docs. It can also be used for projects that aren&#x27;t related to GOV.UK, as long as they don&#x27;t use the GOV.UK branding",

Sadly another government change was to end all this development. But in the end near as i can figure though a lot of the bosses left the changes have continued but at a slower rate.<p>No government website in America begins to compare to the clearness and simplicity that exists in Britain nearly a dozen years later."

What was left were the hardliners, the truly crazy and those willing to say anything at all in return for power."

The participants used their <i>real</i> credentials to attempt a <i>real</i> bank transaction, and Microsoft studied what might count as a red flag and stop them from attempting this transaction on a bogus site, variations in UI warnings, layout etc..<p>Nothing. Nothing you could do stopped users from persisting in their goal, despite all the red flags, humans get stuck on a mission, it&#x27;s called &quot;Get-there-itis&quot; and it kills private pilots, it causes those &quot;How could you be such a moron?&quot; bridge strikes you see on Youtube, it&#x27;s a defect in human psychology, you have to design <i>knowing</i> that this defect exists.<p>So what works? Brick Wall UX. When the user <i>can&#x27;t</i> do the wrong thing they won&#x27;t. They&#x27;ll still try of course, but now they can&#x27;t succeed (in giving their credentials to crooks)."

We&#x27;d have to know the methodology to be sure (maybe you have a link to this?), but there are many factors that could lead participants to ignore the warning signs and persevere. For instance, the participants may have been offered a sum of money for their involvement, and believed (consciously or subconsciously) that they had to &#x27;pass&#x27; the test to earn it. Or, it could have been pride and the desire not to lose face; perhaps even the sentiment of &quot;the sooner I can finish this daft test, the sooner I can leave&quot;!<p>There is a common attitude in the computer industry that designers&#x2F;developers know better than users, but software users are representative of the general population and are thus no more or less intelligent than average. I believe it&#x27;s primarily a lack of understanding of how software works that makes online phishing scams work. &#x27;Brick Wall UX&#x27; can only go so far to compensate for that, and it comes at a cost of making software less flexible for the end-user."
