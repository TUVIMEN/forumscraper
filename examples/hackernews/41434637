      "text": "I recently interviewed for a senior level role for a complex domain (payments), this is an area I have more than a decade of experience. The interviews went flawlessly because I know payments inside out, not just in US but in UK and most EU jurisdictions. The funny bit is that the role being senior, influencing, soft communication skills and managing conflict are even more important than the subject matter expertise and I nailed those areas as well (they threw an obnoxious senior manager that kept interrupting me as I calmly answered the questions, the follow up was that my performance was a masterclass in handling conflict). The final round was with a business person who fancied himself the defacto subject matter expert and kept throwing trivia questions about payments. His plan was to go through as much trivia as he could until he could find something to justify a no. His last question (he literally stopped as soon as he got his way after this question), the question was, have you got personal experience working on real-time payments? I do, in more than one countries (US introduced this very recently as part of fednow), he pushed me about the fednow and obviously this is so new that I only have read the specifications and evaluated a few vendors to decide whether to build or buy. He used this as justification to make a negative reommendation, claiming I don&#x27;t have real-time payments experience.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t want to work in an environment like that, it was a large US bank and where their biggest problems are not product innovation or focusing on customer but production failures! An area I have rescued several large companies in, apart from payments expertise and made sure I communicated this. But sometimes you get lucky and don&#x27;t have to find out the hard way that this place is not pleasant."

To me this signals that a company not only has a toxic culture, but embraces it. Such places attract personalities who love conflict and once there are enough people, they set the culture.<p>What doesn&#x27;t get said often is that conflict is a failure of leadership. Often all it takes to resolve conflict is for one very senior leader to snap their fingers and say, &quot;Guys, I want you two to make this happen&quot;. But what happens is that leadership is either far too disconnected from the ground to align their teams, or they constitutionally advocate conflict within their teams in the name of competitiveness. Either way, such places can be hell to work in."

I wasn’t adversarial or rude about it, I just wanted to find out if they were comfortable saying “I don’t know”, because not knowing something is an everyday part of technical work, but not being comfortable saying it can be big source of issues.<p>The candidates who were otherwise the most competent tended to be the most comfortable with the I don’t know answer. Getting defensive about it I always considered to be a red flag."

Even the OP assumes that the interviewee will start guessing with 50, but, because of the way binary search works, you can select an initial guess that is offset from 50 (with a randomized offset each time) to defeat trivial adversarial attacks that attempt to game the heuristic, while still mostly reaping the benefits of binary search.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see someone do the analysis of what the optimal random-offset-selection algorithm would be to counter trivial adversarial choices."

So I asked him if you perform a character edit format instruction in EBCDIC mode with the leading zero specifier and the numeric value is too great to fit into the allocated field, after the instruction completes, what is the state of the program status word overflow field?&quot;  Then trounced the guy for not knowing. The thing is the guy asking the question happened to have worked on that instruction when he worked at Amdahl.<p>One thing to know is the IBM 360 and descendant family had a commercial instruction set option that, in a single instruction, could take a format value and generate a string output that followed some format specification, kind of like sprintf but with even more options."

I would venture to say that 99% of the time it&#x27;s complete un-indicative of how effective the candidate would be in the role.<p>Referring to my aforementioned bad interview - the question, after all the technical stuff had been cleared (this was for a junior frontend dev role) - they asked &quot;imagine a car is broken and not running.  how would you go about figuring out how to fix it?&quot;.  Being someone whose brother and father enjoyed fixing cars, I asked every question about the problem with the car - how it was used, what sort of car it was, what the issue with the car was, what prior problems the car had, etc.  I got a bunch of useless answers.  After I exhausted all my questions, the interviewers told me I had failed.  Why?  One interview brought out a tiny hotwheels car with a missing wheel out of his pocket, and proclaimed to say &quot;you didn&#x27;t ask if it was a real car, it&#x27;s a toy car, of fucking course it&#x27;s not supposed to run like a real car!&quot; while laughing hysterically.
