Even the OP assumes that the interviewee will start guessing with 50, but, because of the way binary search works, you can select an initial guess that is offset from 50 (with a randomized offset each time) to defeat trivial adversarial attacks that attempt to game the heuristic, while still mostly reaping the benefits of binary search.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see someone do the analysis of what the optimal random-offset-selection algorithm would be to counter trivial adversarial choices."

His story went something like this, I don&#x27;t recall the exact details:<p>&quot;I was interviewing a candidate who said he had experience programming on an IBM&#x2F;370. So I asked him if you perform a character edit format instruction in EBCDIC mode with the leading zero specifier and the numeric value is too great to fit into the allocated field, after the instruction completes, what is the state of the program status word overflow field?&quot; Then trounced the guy for not knowing. The thing is the guy asking the question happened to have worked on that instruction when he worked at Amdahl.<p>One thing to know is the IBM 360 and descendant family had a commercial instruction set option that, in a single instruction, could take a format value and generate a string output that followed some format specification, kind of like sprintf but with even more options."

I would venture to say that 99% of the time it&#x27;s complete un-indicative of how effective the candidate would be in the role.<p>Referring to my aforementioned bad interview - the question, after all the technical stuff had been cleared (this was for a junior frontend dev role) - they asked &quot;imagine a car is broken and not running. how would you go about figuring out how to fix it?&quot;. Being someone whose brother and father enjoyed fixing cars, I asked every question about the problem with the car - how it was used, what sort of car it was, what the issue with the car was, what prior problems the car had, etc. I got a bunch of useless answers. After I exhausted all my questions, the interviewers told me I had failed. Why? One interview brought out a tiny hotwheels car with a missing wheel out of his pocket, and proclaimed to say &quot;you didn&#x27;t ask if it was a real car, it&#x27;s a toy car, of fucking course it&#x27;s not supposed to run like a real car!&quot; while laughing hysterically. How on earth does that indicate if a junior frontend dev can do their job or not? Stupid."

In real life, if someone wanted to know about the vacuum cleaners in landfills too, <i>they&#x27;d tell you in the first place</i>.<p>If an interviewer wants to see if someone can ask clarifying questions, they&#x27;d better come up with a scenario where it would make sense to ask them in a normal conversation. Scenarios that are genuinely ambiguous to anyone with common sense.<p>Otherwise interviews become this weird cargo-cult thing where you have to learn that interviewers present common-sense clear questions, but you have to ask silly clarification questions that you wouldn&#x27;t in real life, just so somebody can check a box that you asked questions."

For example, you could flip 6 coins and add the number of heads, then flip another coin to decide whether you add or subtract the number of heads from 50 for your starting guess.

One such nash equillibrium my sim found was having the Ballmer player mix between picking either end of the range (not always 1 or 100 but around those numbers). I have the Ballmer player winning with around $.85-$1.00 EV per round. The resulting player strategy was to also try to start their binary search at the extreme ends of the range and hope they guessed the right side. It&#x27;s kind of like the soccer penalty kick dynamic between the shooter and goalie. Goalie wants to pick the same side, shooter wants opposite sides. But with 100 choices, the goal is too wide I think.<p>I now think that not constraining the players remaining choices to follow binary search pattern would completely change the resulting equilibrium and improve the results for the player. But that would be more computationally demanding to calculate because there&#x27;s a strategy choice for every range of choices. And also I&#x27;ve avoided work for 2 hours by working on this so that&#x27;s not great haha. I _am_ curious what not constraining the player to binary search would do though..."

You don&#x27;t want to have gaps larger than three between your positive guesses, but there are 32 gaps for a total of 96 possibilities, or an excess of 27 over the numbers you need to cover.<p>It seems like a lot of possibilities and I think you can get away with a minimum gap size of one, but let&#x27;s assume you do 5 3-gaps at 1, 25, 50, 75, and 100 and 2-gaps everywhere else. So start with 51, then 26 and 76. Then go up or down 12, then 6, then 3. If you have a gap of two you flip a coin, if a gap of three you pick the middle one.<p>Or if you have them write down the number and you think it has double-digits you could put your 4-gaps below 20. Start with 53 and go up or down 24, 12, 6, and 3 (unless it is below 20, then it is multiples of four.) 59 would pay you a dollar.<p>Your starting guess could be anywhere from 37 to 64 without paying out more than a dollar, but if you start with an extreme, then low odd numbers and high even numbers will have a negative payout. However, I think you can still randomize sufficiently starting with 38 and 63, e.g. 63-31-15-7-3-1."

The final round was with a business person who fancied himself the defacto subject matter expert and kept throwing trivia questions about payments. His plan was to go through as much trivia as he could until he could find something to justify a no. His last question (he literally stopped as soon as he got his way after this question), the question was, have you got personal experience working on real-time payments? I do, in more than one countries (US introduced this very recently as part of fednow), he pushed me about the fednow and obviously this is so new that I only have read the specifications and evaluated a few vendors to decide whether to build or buy. He used this as justification to make a negative reommendation, claiming I don&#x27;t have real-time payments experience.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t want to work in an environment like that, it was a large US bank and where their biggest problems are not product innovation or focusing on customer but production failures! An area I have rescued several large companies in, apart from payments expertise and made sure I communicated this.

In interviews I think you should just be guided by your genuine values and be yourself (well, whatever version of yourself you feel most comfortable bringing to the office every day). It probably doesn’t maximise job offer conversions, but in my experience it maximises being in working environments that I’m most likely to enjoy and fit into well.<p>Edit: By honesty in interviews, I mean to a point. There’s some things you absolutely should lie about in interviews (if you’re confident you can get away with it). For instance “what’s your current salary” is a great question to lie about, that they really have no business asking anyway."

As others have pointed out, this kind of behaviour is a clear sign of a toxic culture. What&#x27;s even more absurd is that it should be the exact opposite. If they&#x27;re looking to grow their team or replace someone, they should be seeking out someone who&#x27;s even better than anyone they currently have.<p>When they nitpick or push for irrelevant details just to find a reason to say &#x27;no,&#x27; it&#x27;s a massive red flag. It shows they&#x27;re not really interested in innovation or solving the real problems, like the endless production failures we&#x27;ve already helped other companies overcome. Honestly, in situations like that, the best thing you can do is apologise for wasting their time and walk away. But I get it when they have the job in your area, it&#x27;s tempting to tolerate the nonsense. Still, it’s a good reminder that sometimes, dodging that bullet is actually a blessing in disguise, even though you are unemployed and running out of money, as I was at the time."

OP was a bit harsh with the stupid comment, and for SWEs EV understanding is not usually a critical thing, but ultimately you’re being asked about the probability and the ability to make good decisions. Trading firms make use of this when hiring traders (most famously Jane Street and also SIG); The thinking is that if someone makes bad decisions with toy games, and their thought process is not analytical, they’re going to make for a bad trader, not making good decisions with millions of dollars on the line. A good example of something that would rule out a trader is: You can flip a coin, if you win you get $1m, if you lose you lose $1m. Would you play? The EV is zero, but the question is about bankroll management and disaster avoidance. As an individual the downside risk of a $1m loss (usually) significantly outweighs the upside of a $1m gain."

What <i>did</i> you learn, Mr Ballmer?<p>To which he literally has no answer: &quot;I learned you need to step back and really ask if you&#x27;re going to make money on this thing&quot;.. uh, okay Steve. Cool. Thanks for your contribution to possibly the worst technical hiring practices in just about any professional field. The technicals are less interesting than seeing even he himself has no real justification for this kind of intellectual hazing."

I find it much easier to work with people with fast recall who can be confident and correct even under time pressure. Nobody wants to sit through many time-consuming meetings that end with “we will check that and get back to you later”.<p>There is a succinct chess joke that summarises what being an expert means: a journalist asked Casablanca how many moves he thinks ahead. He replied, only one, but it is always the best one."
