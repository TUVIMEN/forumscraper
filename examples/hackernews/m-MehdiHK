It operates at OSI Layers 3 and 4 using a WireGuard network, while Telepresence functions primarily at Layer 7 and partly at Layer 4 using application proxies. Because Kloudlite works at Layer 3, it provides a higher level of abstraction for connecting services and devices.<p>You can link multiple clusters—including your local machine—within your team. All environments and services managed by Kloudlite become part of the same WireGuard network.<p>For example, you can create a shared database in a remote cloud cluster, clone environments and apps to a local cluster, and start development. Another developer on a different machine can easily switch to your environment and access the same services, enabling seamless collaboration. Since Kloudlite uses a WireGuard network, any device with a WireGuard client can connect to access these services."

I find the integration with remaining ecosystem (testing, databases, etc.) quite poor.<p>For context, these are my experiences from the last few months of using Nest.js in a project we&#x27;re working on at my company.<p>- It strongly encourages you to use TypeORM, which is just not production ready and has many (sometimes subtle) issues [1]<p>- Logging is often extremely bad. I&#x27;ve encountered issues where I made a mistake in my app bootstrapping code and there were no errors logged, but the application simply didn&#x27;t start. Then I had to play a very frustrating game of commenting out pieces of code until the application would start again<p>- Nest.js error classes (HttpException and those that inherit from it, such as BadRequestException) do not properly inherit from built-in Error, which means that when your tests fail, the only output you&#x27;ll get is &quot;Error: [Object object]&quot; printed to the console without a proper stack trace.<p>- We used their GraphQL module and when we tried to send a few MB of data to the client for initial state, memory usage would balloon to hundreds(!) of megabytes from a single request.<p>- Misconfiguring any part of GraphQL would again lead to an error being thrown somewhere inside their libraries, with a message like &quot;Cannot read propery &#x27;target&#x27; of undefined&quot; with no stack trace or any indication of where the problem might be<p>- Documentation is lacking and doesn&#x27;t do a proper job of documenting the features. Usually it&#x27;s just a hello-world style example without much depth<p>That&#x27;s just my experience, maybe I was just &quot;using it wrong&quot;. But it was definitely far from a smooth experience and lead me to waste countless hours trying to track down and fix obscure issues.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about using Nest.js, I would recommend that you ditch TypeORM and use something else, I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend using GraphQL with Nest.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2065\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2065</a>"

Node might have better performance and concurrency options than some of the others, but it&#x27;s not the best at those either. It&#x27;s not really clear to me that it&#x27;s actually the best at <i>anything</i>. My preference is honestly just to avoid it. In my experience there is always a better tool."

It predicts, for instance, wide replacement of cashiers (which is already happening) and construction workers (which isn&#x27;t yet).<p>&gt;Maybe plumber, give it 20.<p>Perhaps we have different standards for &quot;automated.&quot; Do you expect remote operators standing by ready to take over for a plumberbot or giving it hints at least once per service operation on average in 2036?

And since the DeepDream gizmo, we hear less people talking about how creativity can&#x27;t be automated.<p>Yes, in 20 years the tech will be here for a piece of software to figure out where the pipes must be in a house, make plans to test different hypothesis, plan a procedure of intervention, wiggle tubes together to make them fit without any other human instructions than &quot;this tap does not work, go fix it&quot;. I have some supicions on what the correct way to go is, and am fairly confident that some other ways exist and that we will find one that will work.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on AGI from this point. It really depends on your definitions. Some make AGI an unachievable goal. Under common and reasonnable definitions, yes, we will be close by then but we already are not very far.<p>And in my earlier comments I talk about 95% of unemployement just to cut some of the philosophical debate, but naturally I expect that we will reach 100% pretty quickly."

Unlike static type checking languages, dynamic typed languages gives you huge productivity at start, but eventually that flexibility starts to become maintenance nuisance. Best of the both world is gradually typed systems, like hack or flow from Facebook, where you can start placing type checking later as necessary. So you can be very productive at start, and later be safe at scale."
