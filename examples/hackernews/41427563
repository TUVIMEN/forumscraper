  "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;m pythonbrad and a core maintainer of Afrim - an input method engine for African languages.<p>Afrim want to simplify the typing in African languages and also digitalize the African typing systems. Basically, it wants to solve the problems encountered with current solutions:- slow typing- not easily configurable- keyboard layout dependent- constant bugs<p>Additionally, Afrim offers the following features [1]:- Dataset easily customizable- Keyboard layout independent- Auto completion, autocorrection and autosuggestion- Support all sequential codes<p>Technical details [2]:Afrim is written in Rust and his architecture is inspired of RIME.<p>What&#x27;s next?- Offer an android frontend of the Afrim (in development) [3]- Support more African input methods as possible<p>I would like to have your opinions about this project. I have been working on it so far, and I would like to know how I can improve it.<p>--------------[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#features\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim?tab=readme-ov-file#featu...</a>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pythonbrad.github.io&#x2F;afrim-man&#x2F;for_developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pythonbrad.github.io&#x2F;afrim-man&#x2F;for_developers</a>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;</a>",

I found the video [1] but it has no audio or explanations at all.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d want phonetic input methods, rather than wanting to input your desired character directly. For languages like Chinese I understand because there are thousands of characters, but aren&#x27;t most or all African writing systems based on small alphabets? I shudder to think of having to learn to input English phonetically.<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for opinions, my first one is that your pages need to do a better job at explaining what current problems are (with multiple clear examples for each), where current solutions fail (with clear examples of how), and how your solution is different and better (again, with clear examples).<p>Good luck!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;?tab=readme-ov-file#afrim-keyboard\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;?tab=readme-ov-...</a>"

Typing in Arabic using a standard keyboard layout can be quite cumbersome and slow for us (Most people never took the time to learn it), using latin alphabet for us is just more practical, and doesn&#x27;t require you to learn a new way to type.<p>In our daily communication, when we text, whether with friends or family, we often switch between English, French, or Moroccan dialects. When writing in Moroccan dialect, we frequently use a phonetic system (read in french way) that combines the Latin alphabet with numbers to represent specific sounds or letters that don’t have a direct equivalent in the Latin script.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    ق is replaced by &quot;q&quot;    ع is replaced by &quot;3&quot;    خ is replaced by &quot;5&quot; (though &quot;kh&quot; is more common)    غ is replaced by &quot;4&quot; (or &quot;gh&quot;)    The rest is just a 1 to 1 conversion to how the letter sounds in french    </code></pre>Example phrase :<p>Bro, I woke up and had a sick breakfast.<p>Sat, 3ad fe9t o drabt wa7d ftor khatir."
