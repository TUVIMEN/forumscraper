Statehood Day is an excellent time to start this new forum, kudos to you and your cronies.<br /><br />My name is Mark, also and I have lived in AZ since 1978 when the USAF sent me to Luke, AFB. I grew up in IL and my dad, grandfather, and uncle taught me about guns and hunting since I was old enough to fall over a stalk field. I attended my first NRA sponsored Hunters&#039; Safety Course when I was 7 years old and had passed the instructor&#039;s course when I was 17. It is very sad, indeed, what has happened to the gun laws in my home state. After living in the Valley over 20 years, I now live in Sierra Vista and love the wide-open spaces and clear skies. I joined the Arizona Citizens Defense League (AzCDL)&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.azcdl.org\" class=\"bbc_link\" target=\"_blank\">www.azcdl.org</a> about two years ago, originally as a Sustaining member because I believed they were speaking my language. They were working for the things I believe(d) in and I wanted to add my voice to theirs. Well, I am now a Life member, the SE AZ Area Volunteer Coordinator and am jokingly referred to as the &quot;Road Warrior&quot; since I travel all over this beautiful state to set up booths at gun shows, seeking new members. Memberships in other organizations include: NRA, GOA, JPFO (Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership), you don&#039;t have to be Jewish to belong. <a href=\"http://www.jpfo.org\" class=\"bbc_link\" target=\"_blank\">www.jpfo.org</a><br /><br />Divorced. One daughter &amp; son-in-law and two grand kids, one girl, one boy, ages 8 &amp; 2.<br /><br />Anyway, looking forward to some good, stimulating conversations.<br /><br />",
