      "body": "Good afternoon,<br /><br />I am currently a radiation protection technician student in Tennessee, and I am wondering basically what to expect when I graduate.&nbsp; A few details about me and the program:<br /><br />-We will have a 4-6 month internship with TVA, to include work at Watts Bar, Sequoyah, and Browns Ferry nuke plants a month or so after we graduate.<br />-We will be working primarily with Bartlett to obtain contract jobs to work towards our Senior Tech level<br />-We will be taking the NUF before we graduate. <br /><br />About me:<br />-I was able to attend the NEI Radiation Protection forum in San Diego this year, where I was able to network with some of the higher up's at Bartlett, as well as numerous radiation protection managers from many of the plants. <br />-I am currently the VP of the American Nuclear Society at my school.<br />-I also have a 4 year bachelors degree in business finance.<br /><br />I was wondering,&nbsp; what is to be expected in terms of job outlook for us, as well as what is the best tactic to make sure we are applying for any available jobs for junior techs.&nbsp; In other words, what advice do you have for me/us at this point in our radiation protection career?<br /><br />Thank you!",

The grass is always greener on the opposite side from where you are standing.<br />Yes you can make a living as a road tech and be home 6 months of the year, however there are prices to pay for that goal.&nbsp; It can take 4-6 years to cross the required experience line to become a 3.1 ANSI&nbsp; Sr. Tech. There are a lot of Jr. Techs that give up before reaching the 3 year qualification. Also once you do become a Sr. Tech you will notice that the divorce rate for road techs is VERY high ( due to only being home 6 months&nbsp; a year). The availability of jobs will be decreasing as more plants are shut down and placed in Safe Store (not many decommissioning jobs in the next 10 years).<br />If you do make it past 18.1 qualification you will notice that there is not a lot of opportunity for real on the job training due to short outages and time pressure, ( I know there is no time pressure, or so I have been told over in 30 years worth of outages ).&nbsp; The system has generated a lot of Techs that do not have the experience or ability to cover high risk jobs due to the above mentioned time pressure issues.<br />Enough of the real world stuff.&nbsp; I hope you are successful in achieving whatever goals you set for yourself and that the grass is greener for you on the nuclear side of the fence.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Old HP<br />&nbsp;",

You may want to start your own company one day.&nbsp; As for becoming a Migrant Nuclear Worker, the first three or so years are very HARD. Not a lot of jobs out there for Jr's., or even 18.1's. <br /><br />Road life is fun and exciting when you first start out. New plants, new people, new places to see.&nbsp; However, if you have a family waiting for you at home, that excitement goes away pretty quick.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe you'll get some hours toward being a Sr, once you complete your coursework (1000hrs?)- if you havent already.&nbsp; The fact that you have a 4-yr degree should help as well.&nbsp; (about another 1000 hrs?) <br /><br />I think being an 18.1 is 4000 hrs. If you have an opportunity to take a long term (9month - 1yr) DOE gig, DO IT! That's another 1000 hr's under your belt.&nbsp; Bartlett has a lot of DOE jobs available.&nbsp;",

I had the pleasure of meeting the OP and making his acquaintance over the summer at the NEI forum, and I look forward to meeting up with him down the road as we navigate this world of RP. While some may find posters like Content1 discouraging, I welcome it. Though his views may not jibe with the vision of the Admin when he created this site, it does serve a purpose in giving a different perspective from his side of RP work and life. For those determined to still go forth, they do so knowing that there are those in the field who aren't happy with the situation and have legitimate gripes. Proceed at your own peril or risk. We may not want posters chasing away potential and future nukeworkers on the forum, but those posters are no different than the guys from the barracks who told me how much my time at a new unit would suck upon checking in. They'll be at every job site and every assignment. There are many situations we can't control in life; we do, however, have control over how we react to them. There's a positive to every situation. For Content1, it's spending more time at home with his family if he gets out of the nuclear business.<br /><br />Personally, coming to this business wasn't about the money. I came from the Marine Corps and we weren't the highest paid employees on the wage scale. I pursued the education and the business because it's something I honestly enjoyed -- the science behind it all, the opportunity to delve deeper and learn the answers to why instead of being content with how -- not because I wanted to be a millionaire. I've met a lot of very intelligent people, both on this board and in my personal interactions, who know more than I can ever hope to about RP because of unique experiences, and I want to be a sponge, absorbing as much as I can. I would never recommend money being the sole or most heavily weighted deciding factor. I do know that some of the wages being made by house, contract, and traveling road techs would turn a lot of hard-working American folks green with envy. No, not everyone is making 6 figures a year. Wages may not be what they used to when inflation and rising costs are factored in. Unless someone on this forum has been forced into poverty by the changing conditions, I don't think we'll see eye to eye on that matter. I've seen poverty firsthand. I've been homeless and slept in a car for weeks at a time. Any grass is greener than tan cloth interior in a cramped backseat and daily communal showers. There are a lot of people who would love to have the financial complaints that we're talking about here. While things may not be as good as what some of you were accustomed to before, it's infinitely better than some of the places I've been in my lifetime.<br /><br />There are a lot of opportunities out there for people wishing to pursue the field. DOE, commercial, contract, and labs are all available. The education doesn't have to stop. If you want more opportunities, shoot for CHP. Branch into the business side of the house. Perhaps instructing and teaching are desirable. The point is that a person with drive and ambition can still find a successful living in this field. If that individual doesn't want to be a traveling tech for 30 years, then there are other options. Content1's postings provide pretty solid reasons for not going that route, so they had benefit. I wish you well going forward and thank you for all the hard work you've put into this industry. Merry Christmas to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to answer questions and lend your wisdom.",

      "body": "No one wants to discourage a new HP from being the best in their field. But as another old HP and also being one of the first few women who came in to the field, my ideals were shattered and reset often enough. It became personal to change the status quo from a field void of respected women to being one that who could stand for her ideals.<br /><br />That being said, year 34 is nearly over. The Old HP may not have said things to your liking but it was said in honesty. Greed and poor economy go hand in hand.&nbsp; Yes the power plants have learned to be efficient. Yes they purposely under staff and cut corners today to save money and time. HP work means time to them. <br /><br />But here is my short list of things to consider.<br /><br />Outage schedules are not staggered such that you work six months a year. And though some do when you speak to them about where they live it will make sense as to why it could be possible. They live close to several plants usually. As a rule its one outage in spring and one in fall.&nbsp; Two months to five months of work per year. So better have plan B.<br /><br />A junior will be kept a jr as long as the contracting company can get away with it.&nbsp; They dont care about your goals or education. They want experience doing job coverage and they are not wanting to spend money on you to train you.<br /><br />I would say 6-9 years working part time is the real time it will take. So consider your age and add 9 and try to imagine how you will live on part time work until then. This is reality.<br /><br />Persistence and diligence always moves things. One reason I still fight for change and make reports to the regulators and dont play politics. I am a lifetime learner. I am not bored with nuclear, I am disgusted with the position nuclear is now faced with.&nbsp; We are going from a nuclear family to a dysfunctional family where greed rules.&nbsp; And those with jobs wont jeopardize their jobs to help you. They will remain silent. But that is not my profile. I work as hard to make changes in this field as I do managing my career.<br /><br />Lots of sage advice has been given to you. I strongly advise you to consider what you have been told. You have not lived on the road the way we do. Have not been cheated or lied to by employers, faced the long hours, the life and come home to find that home changed while you worked hard. Home is where you are even if working on the road. Otherwise you are working and putting life on hold. Hard to even that one out. And spouses rarely will travel, home school kids, keep the hours and most importantly understand your work schedule as well as the consumed person you become working the outage hours. It is all consuming. You wont hold up better than others. All suffer during outages. Its hard work and it gets harder to keep the pace.<br /><br />On a final word, the cut back on job coverage at power plants is the new trend. Do the work of what 3 techs use to do, job coverage is not done, avoid posting with ideas of &quot;open controls&quot;, survey reports go unwritten. They hurry every job, cram training, cut every corner they imagine. Right now they have taken things over the cliff. So new juniors are being groomed to accept their new way of radiation protection. You will be groomed.<br /><br />I would say if you are willing to do what is right against all odds, you will find something you seek. Otherwise becoming just another new age drone is a position you cant pay me to take. Our job is to protect people, not make money for the plant by by passing the safety of others.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wont compromise human safeguards. Consequently I have to do the hard business of reporting to the NRC and push back hard at every turn.<br /><br />Its a sacrifice I make, have made and will make again. Staying true to what is right is harder than you know. So the respect that needs to be given to those sharing with you should be given. It is advice from hard experience.<br /><br />Good Luck Grasshopper<br /><br />&nbsp;",

I saw those same postings for the physical science techs. Portsmouth and Bremerton were hiring recently, with Bremerton hiring dozens.

Sometimes it's great but you're a fool to expect it.&nbsp; Be willing to go anywhere and do anything and be prepared for having ZERO work for a long long time.&nbsp; Have a backup plan.&nbsp; Be prepared to get screwed over by some employers and don't be naive about the &quot;good employers&quot;...this is a business.&nbsp; It's sink or swim.&nbsp; Whether you're a good tech or a terrible tech will make absolutely no difference to most employers.&nbsp; You're just a body to bill for.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes you have to resolve yourself to becoming a body that gets paid versus a body who starves.&nbsp; &nbsp;I applied to ~150 jobs and sent resumes to countless companies before I found a job.&nbsp; I heard back from &lt;1% of those applications and resume submissions but my determination paid off eventually.&nbsp; And eventually I found some good companies out there who appreciate hard work, desire to learn, a good fundamental base of knowledge.&nbsp; But this industry is becoming watered down with stupid very quickly and my advice is to do what I do...find an old guy at every job you work and get every last bit of knowledge you can from him and don't forget it!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Be careful who you make friends with out here too bc once you're on the road it's dog eat dog.&nbsp; On the same note, (be very careful) find some young and hungry techs who have their ducks in a row and keep in touch with them all the time.&nbsp; Help each other find work.&nbsp; Never turn down a job unless you have one that's better or lasts longer.&nbsp; Save your money!!!&nbsp; Have a nest egg to get yourself wherever you need to go and cover hotel, gas, and all your other bills and expenses for a minimum of 2 weeks.&nbsp; Also, Good Luck!&nbsp; You'll need all of it you can get!&nbsp; <br /><br />Ps.&nbsp; I wouldn't trade this life for anything.&nbsp; I absolutely love what I do for work even when I hate it.&nbsp;",
