Wayne said there were some issues with it relating to an earlier upgrade I think.<br /> <br /> My feelings on vB5 are genuine, having played with it. It is a true attempt at taking the somewhat stale forum software platform and trying to be a bit different, while still providing end user familiarity. The power of some features will possibly be realised more as the product matures.<br /> <br /> What we did NOT need in vB5, in my humble opinion, was &quot;here's another forum, nice new style, but basically looks and functions just like all the others&quot;.",

I'm certainly not claiming it's perfect and in any event it's not out of beta yet.<br /> I do think that it shows great promise, and I do quite enjoy using it on my own live &quot;demo&quot; site. I tweaked the style a bit and I think what I have looks pretty smart.

But it ends there. <br /> <br /> 1) Unable to attach any other document other than image file.<br /> 2) Creating a page and forum is easy. I agree. Changing them messes up somehow. For example, I changed domain.com/main-forum to domain.com/general-forum. The name is changed. Then I changed my mind and switched back to Main Forum. What happens is that Main Forum still points to domain.com/general-forum. <br /> 3) Same for page. I created a page and changed the name. Later when I changed back, it keeps redirecting back to the old page. For example, created a page called &quot;terms&quot; and later change to &quot;privacy&quot;, then later back to &quot;terms&quot; again, the domain.com/terms point to domain.com/privacy? with some cache issue.<br /> 4) Unable to delete any new custom module created. That becomes an eyesore.<br /> 5) No category listing on the side bar. Try creating 10 blogs (categories) and they all appear at the submenu (below top menu). Are they going to be 2 or 3 lines to accommodate this? Still waiting for the category side bar module to be available. The workaround is to add ourselves to the navigation menu now. <br /> 6) If you assign someone with full admin rights, he still be be assiged role as a Blog Moderator before he can create a new blog. This is funny, as I thought the Administrator has all the rights. <br /> <br /> It isn't as smooth, but I think it is in the right direction and that is why it is still in beta. I really hope the development can catchup asap as I am not testing it but trying on a new site.",

They added CMS and Blogs to VB4 (This is why I bought VB4). But this is not enough. If VB5 will be same like VB4 - just CMS, forums and no real Blogs - (with a new engine under the hood) - it can be a huge failure.",

Except that PHPFox actually looks as polished as I would wish vbulletin would be.</div> </div> </div> </div>I agree. You are correct that VB5 seems to be aiming for similar community setups. So, let's expand the questions.<br /> <br /> <b>What are the biggest differences in the following (<u><i><span style=\"color:#b22222\">not</span> counting the obvious costs, developers, unofficial addons, &amp; technology used</i></u>):</b><br /> <br /> <b>PHPFox vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that PHPFox lacks? What features does PHPFox have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>SocialEngine vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that SocialEngine lacks? What features does SocialEngine have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>JomSocial (with Joomla) vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that JomSocial lacks? What features does JomSocial have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>BuddyPress (with BBPress &amp; WP) vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that BuddyPress lacks? What features does BuddyPress have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>VB3.8 vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that VB3.8 lacks? What features does VB3.8 have that VB5 lacks? IMHO, VB3.8 has the best <u>features</u> of any VB version to date. If only we could have enhanced those features for end users as suggested over the years in the suggestion forum. Some would argue otherwise or point to VB4.x.<br /> <br /> <b>VB4.x vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that VB4.x lacks? What features does VB4.x have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>IPB3.4 (plus official addons) vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that IPB3.4 lacks? What features does IPB3.4 have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>XF vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that XF lacks? What features does XF have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>Woltlab BB (plus official addons) vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that Woltlab lacks? What features does Woltlab have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> <b>All the free &amp; hosted forum community scripts vs VB5?</b> What features does VB5 have that the free &amp; hosted forum community scripts lack? What features does the free &amp; hosted forum community scripts have that VB5 lacks?<br /> <br /> I guess I'm looking for reasons to be impressed and/or reasons why I'm not so impressed. The BETA excuse means nothing to me, so please don't throw that one. Beta, in short, normally means feature locked and ready for mass testing before becoming stable...IMHO.<br /> <br /> Thank you and have a splendid week*",

Although, lacking features is an important issue for a comparison. But the better question is, what is better in vB5 than the rest? vB could have some lacking features and still have some special new stuff that makes it stand out and the good of those few &quot;new things&quot; could outweigh any lacking features. Unfortunately, that just isn't the case. <br /> <br /> Scott</div> </div> </div> </div>You are correct, Scott. I was indeed looking for someone to point out what is infact better in VB5 than the rest and what those better things are since I'm not able to see them myself. I'd like nothing more than to love VB again. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening atm.

That may change in the future.</div> </div> </div> </div>Can honestly say this is one thing I am quite supprised with. On VB4 the difference in performance between a forum with 10 posts and one with a few 100k posts is quite different. However on vb5 this doesnt seem to be the case. I know the upgrades on my site seem to show marginal difference between an empty forum and one with 750k posts in it. Dont get me wrong its still not fast enough for my liking (although a million times better than it has been), but it is showing promise bit by bit. <br /> <br /> I'm kinda of the opinion that as long as it seems to be moving forward I will move mine over eventually and if it continues at current rate I cant see eventually being a long way off either. Doesnt seem like it at the moment granted, but the simple math says that with so many bug fixes per beta release the count is coming down fast. Still got a few of my bugbares to fix yet mind <img src=\"https://forum.vbulletin.com/core/images/smilies/tongue.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"stick out tongue\" smilieid=\"6\" class=\"inlineimg\" /> LOL",

My big board has not been upgraded for 5 years. I never upgraded my big board from vb3.8 to vb4, because only 3 years after release of 'vb4 gold' and after thousands of bugs were fixed I consider 4.2 as gold. vb4.2 would be a viable foundation to build upon if there would be several years of active development by IB coming. A major upgrade costs me 6 months of rewriting addons. Unfortunately, now that it has a reasonable state with only 850 bugs, its basically pronounced dead by the focus on vb5. Therefore after 3 years of waiting for vb4 to be fixed, vb4 is still not a viable upgrade for my needs. So the focus is on vb5.<br /> <br /> <br /> The information given before the release of the beta certainly gave reason to be hopeful and even excited. <br /> <br /> I think there are a lot of good ideas in vb5, including:<br /> <ol class=\"decimal\"><li>Everything API, so that it becomes easy to replace or modify much of the front end.</li> <li>Site builder</li> <li>Modules/apps</li> <li>Shift from forum oriented to content type oriented. (as this allows custom content types and improvement of blog, groups, etc)</li> <li>Replacing the vastly outdated vb4 styling</li> <li>Updating to modern technology, including jquery, php5.4, CSS3, html5, etc. </li> </ol><br /> <br /> These 6 points above are gold in my opinion and if executed well are very good reasons to upgrade to vb5.<br /> <br /> <br /> Then the 'beta' came out and showcased the really poor state that the product is in. While the above 6 points are very attractive aspects of vb5, it seems to me that vb5 has no future for the reasons below. I am hereby asking staff, management and customers to alleviate my concerns below, cause like Mert, Shawn, Scott, Gladius, and many other big board owners, I am halfway out the door.<br /> <br /> <br /> <ol class=\"decimal\"><li>Many senior developers including Rafio, Shawn(digitalpoint), Floren state that <a href=\"http://adminextra.com/threads/connect-demo.6019/page-4#post-52885\" target=\"_blank\">vb5 has horrible code quality</a> and is the code/design of the software is a complete disaster and that it would be best for IB to <a href=\"http://adminextra.com/threads/connect-demo.6019/page-6#post-52955\" target=\"_blank\">scrap it and start over</a>. (and similar conclusions)<br /> You can fix bugs. You can hardly fix bad software design. I thought that the main reason for rewriting vb4 was the fact that various issues can not be resolved without resolving bad software design. vb5 seems like a shaky foundation to build upon, which predicts problems for the future.</li> <li>Judging by the poor state the 'beta' is in, it seems to me that it will take years, before vb5 will be bug free and have all needed functions.</li> <li>It remains to be seen if IB will keep developing vb5 after the initial wave of sales.<br /> vb4 took 3 years to get to a somewhat reasonable level of bugs (850 at present) which included about 2 years of IB barely raising a finger while customers struggled. IB even went completely silent and unresponsive towards customers for quite some time here. The seem to have no problem with advertising malfunctioning products like the mobile suite. Management seems to be of the opinion that releasing bug ridden products is OK.<br /> It seems that vb5 will be released with a massive load of issues and an absence of features. After the initial wave of sales, there is no financial incentive for IB to do anything again. Therefore it makes no sense to purchase vb5 before its bug free and feature complete.</li> <li>Despite various requests from customers vBS has not taken away concerns about possible user data mining or data use by Internet Brands and its affiliates/websites. Internet Brands operates thousands of websites and competes with vbulletin customers. vbulletin makes up a tiny fraction of IB's interests. A simple statement here and in a privacy policy that applies to vb5 would take away these concerns. The fact that vBS / IB does not make it crystal clear that vbulletin customers their website data is safe/protected against use by the Internet Brands network or affiliates, is very worrisome.</li> <li>Advertisements by IB announce 125 new features for vb5. Yet, IB refuses to say what these 125 new features are. To me this comes across as very shady and adds to the uncertainty.</li> <li>vb5 will change all urls which will make all inbound link juice go dead. A second concern is if Google will successfully reindex all pages and internal links. This remains to be seen. </li> </ol><br /> <br /> For the reasons above it seems to me that vb5 has no future. <br /> I would be happy if my concerns are alleviated.</div> </div> </div> </div>The post was never answered.<br /> <br /> Does that explain it to you?<br /> <br /> In any case, I have indeed asked PHPFOX to enhance their forum software in order to cater to the current market demand. Its certainly not just a facebook clone, as it is also a twitter, wordpress and youtube clone, including a marketplace and has better social groups than vbulletin. But while their suite is better than vbulletin, their forum is weak. Therefore its not suited for my big board.",

We can't. I am sure you are probably to young to know what a BBS is. Back in the early 90's before AOL came along and everyone was able to get on the internet we had what was called BBS's. Bulletin Board Systems. You would login through the phone line. You had to have a modem. Anyway you would login to the host computer and you could chat, download files, etc... When AOL came along, BBS's started to die out. Why do that when you can surf the internet? That is what is going to happen to forums. People can go onto Facebook and connect with old friends and family, play games, discuss things, etc... So again, why would they want to join another facebook type site when they have facebook? What are we going to offer them that they cant get on the real facebook? NOTHING! So what is the point? What we will have to offer is less features and less people to connect with, so again, why would anyone want to join our facebook clones?",

When you join a Facebook group to discuss a topic everyone in that group has access to your personal information, not to mention the data mining Facebook itself does for the privilege of allowing you an account. There are no Facebook police to keep the discussion on-topic or even at a minimal level of adulthood. There are hundreds or thousands of people all talking while nobody is listening and the conversation is all but impossible to follow.

The first works fine, I would suggest checking your connection. <br /> <br /> As for the &quot;probably the only person on the planet with a forum for husky owners&quot; it may be an idea to check your facts before posting as you are completely incorrect (as stated by Wayne above). In fact if you type husky forum into google all the first page are different siberian husky forums (apart from the aforementioned bike forum).<br /> <br /> Lets say for arguements sake however you were correct, that should mean my forum will not be overrun by facebook?
