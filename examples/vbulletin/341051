      "content": "It depends on what you want to do. Do you want to get the car running and driving before bodywork or do you want a full on restoration?. If it was me I would get the car running and driving so you will keep your enthusiasm for the car and crack on with the jobs needed. If that is the case, does the engine turn over by hand? Also all suspension and brake components will need replacing or refresh. A full check of fluids and electrical system are in order. Best of luck",

If there's rust there or the seams are gone it's a good sign there will be more problems elsewhere. Yours looks good, the seams are still there so that looks really favourable to the general body condition. A solid estate is a good score as most were worked hard when they became cheap in the 80s for example. Best of luck getting her back on the road.",

The repair panel available now, the so called &quot;shotgun&quot;, combines the box and the inner wing section. Not expensive and makes the job pretty easy and tidy.

Originally used with K-Jet F.I. whereas the D was used the D-Jet that came before it. Always use new followers with a new cam.<br /> Letters on the pistons are their grade. Volvo matched the pistons to the bore sizes. Original bore sizes could vary fractionally, often due to wear on the boring tool. Are you considering using the original pistons?",

Over size rings are a stop gap, but could be considered if you are only going to do low miles over the next few years. If you can get away with standard rings they should be run in carefully on newly honed bores, as should oversized ones of course.",
