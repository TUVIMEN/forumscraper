      "content": "<p>Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works. But it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.</p> <p>Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.</p> <pre><code> (F) A-B-C ↑ master </code></pre> <h3>Option 1: <code>git reset --hard</code></h3> <p>You want to <strong>destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes</strong>. You do this:</p> <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1 </code></pre> <p>The result is:</p> <pre><code> (F) A-B ↑ master </code></pre> <p>Now B is the HEAD. Because you used <code>--hard</code>, your files are reset to their state at commit B.</p> <h3>Option 2: <code>git reset</code></h3> <p>Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off. You want to <strong>undo the commit but keep your changes</strong> for a bit of editing before you do a better commit. Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:</p> <pre><code> (F) A-B-C ↑ master </code></pre> <p>Do this, leaving off the <code>--hard</code>:</p> <pre><code>git reset HEAD~1 </code></pre> <p>In this case the result is:</p> <pre><code> (F) A-B-C ↑ master </code></pre> <p>In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit. When you do a <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit. But (unless you use <code>--hard</code>) you leave your files as they were. So now <code>git status</code> shows the changes you had checked into C. You haven't lost a thing!</p> <h3>Option 3: <code>git reset --soft</code></h3> <p>For the lightest touch, you can even <strong>undo your commit but leave your files and your <a href=\"https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WhatIsTheIndex\" rel=\"noreferrer\">index</a></strong>:</p> <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 </code></pre> <p>This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your <em>index</em> alone. When you do <code>git status</code>, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before. In fact, right after this command, you could do <code>git commit</code> and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.</p> <h3>Option 4: you did <code>git reset --hard</code> and need to get that code back</h3> <p>One more thing: Suppose you <strong>destroy a commit</strong> as in the first example, <strong>but then discover you needed it after all</strong>? Tough luck, right?</p> <p>Nope, there's <em>still</em> a way to get it back. Type this</p> <pre><code>git reflog </code></pre> <p>and you'll see a list of (partial) commit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SHAs</a> (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in. Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:</p> <pre><code>git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed </code></pre> <p>You've now resurrected that commit. Commits don't actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn't mean to get rid of.</p>",

Considering the start case below, <code>reset</code>, <code>rebase</code> and <code>filter-branch</code> can all be used to rewrite your history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtqYJ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtqYJ.png\" alt=\"Star-case\" /></a></p>\n<p><em><strong>How can <em>C1</em> and <em>C2</em> be undone to remove the <code>tmp.log</code> file from each commit?</strong></em></p>\n<p>In the examples below, absolute commit references are used, but it works the same way if you're more used to relative references (i.e. <code>HEAD~2</code> or <code>HEAD@{n}</code>).</p>\n<h4>Alternative 1: <code>reset</code></h4>\n<pre><code>$ git reset --soft t56pi\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UEmaO.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UEmaO.png\" alt=\"using-reset\" /></a></p>\n<p>With <code>reset</code>, a branch can be reset to a previous state, and any compounded changes be reverted to the <em>Staging Area</em>, from where any unwanted changes can then be discarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> As <code>reset</code> clusters all previous changes into the <em>Staging Area</em>, individual commit meta-data is lost. If this is not OK with you, chances are you're probably better off with <code>rebase</code> or <code>filter-branch</code> instead.</p>\n<h4>Alternative 2: <code>rebase</code></h4>\n<pre><code>$ git rebase --interactive t56pi\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h4IuR.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h4IuR.png\" alt=\"using-rebase\" /></a></p>\n<p>Using an interactive <code>rebase</code> each offending commit in the branch can be rewritten, allowing you to modify and discard unwanted changes. In the infographic above, the source tree on the right illustrates the state post <code>rebase</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step-by-step</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select from which commit the rebase should be based (e.g. <code>t56pi</code>)</li>\n<li>Select which commits you'd like to change by replacing <code>pick</code> with <code>edit</code>. Save and close.</li>\n<li>Git will now stop on each selected commit allowing you to reset <code>HEAD</code>, remove the unwanted files, and create brand new commits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> With <code>rebase</code> much of the commit meta data is kept, in contrast to the <code>reset</code> alternative above. This is most likely a preferred option, if you want to keep much of your history but only remove the unwanted files.</p>\n<h4>Alternative 3: <code>filter-branch</code></h4>\n<pre><code>$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -r ./tmp.log' t56pi..HEAD\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above command would filter out the file <code>./tmp.log</code> from all commits in the desired range <code>t56pi..HEAD</code> (assuming our initial start case from above). See below illustration for clarity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K0CSV.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K0CSV.png\" alt=\"using-filter-branch\" /></a></p>\n<p>Similar to <code>rebase</code>, <code>filter-branch</code> can be used to wipe unwanted files from a subsection of a branch. Instead of manually editing each commit through the rebase process, <code>filter-branch</code> can automatically preformed the desired action on each commit.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just like <code>rebase</code>, <code>filter-branch</code> would preserve the rest of the commit meta-data, by only discarding the desired file. Notice how <em>C1</em> and <em>C2</em> have been rewritten, and the log-file discarded from each commit.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Just like anything related to software development, there are multiple ways to achieve the same (or similar) outcome for a give problem. You just need to pick the one most suitable for your particular case.</p>\n<h4>Finally - a friendly advice</h4>\n<p>Do note that all three alternatives above rewrites the history completely. Unless you know exactly what you're doing and have good communication within your team - only rewrite commits that have not yet been published remotely!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source:</strong></em> All examples above are borrowed from this <a href=\"https://blog.git-init.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blog</a>.</p>",

During a commit operation, the\n  files that are staged gets added to an index.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's take an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>- A - B - C (master)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>HEAD</code> points to <code>C</code> and the index matches <code>C</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>--soft</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When we execute <code>git reset --soft B</code> with the intention of <strong>removing the commit C</strong> and <strong>pointing the master/HEAD to B</strong>. </li>\n<li>The master/HEAD will now point to B, but the <strong>index still has changed from C</strong>. </li>\n<li>When executing <code>git status</code> you could see the files indexed in <strong>commit C</strong> as <strong>staged</strong>. </li>\n<li>Executing a <code>git commit</code> at this point will create a new commit with <strong>the same changes as C</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>--mixed</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Execute <code>git reset --mixed B</code>. </li>\n<li>On execution, master/HEAD will point to B and the <strong>index is also modified to match B</strong> because of the mixed flag used.  </li>\n<li>If we run git commit at this point, nothing will happen since the <strong>index matches HEAD</strong>.</li>\n<li>We still have the changes in the working directory, but since they're not in the index, <strong>git status shows them as unstaged</strong>. </li>\n<li>To commit them, you would <code>git add</code> and then commit as usual.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>--hard</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Execute <code>git reset --hard B</code></li>\n<li>On execution, master/HEAD will point to B <strong>and modifies your working directory</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong>changes added in C</strong> and <strong>all the uncommitted changes</strong> will be <strong>removed</strong>.</li>\n<li>Files in the working copy will match the commit B, this will result in loosing permanently all changes which were made in commit C plus uncommitted changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope this comparison of flags that are available to use with <code>git reset</code> command will help someone to use them wisely.

Effectively, it’s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won’t show up in your repository history.</p>\n<p>The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of the form, “Oops, forgot to add a file” or “Darn, fixing a typo in last commit”.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2.4 Git Basics - Undoing Things</a></em></p>",

You can use <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-parse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>git rev-parse</code></a> for that.</p>\n<pre><code>$ git rev-parse main^\n6bffe1cb1ed66a052a5a3224d1a778a64f6c357f\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that you can use <code>main^</code>, <code>main~</code>, <code>main~1</code>, <code>main^1</code>, to get the first parent commit. More about differences between <code>^</code> and <code>~</code> in the manual <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>gitrevisions(7)</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Then you have to update the branch main to points to the previous commit</p>\n<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/main 6bffe1cb1ed66a052a5a3224d1a778a64f6c357f\n</code></pre>\n<h3>b) Using only update-ref</h3>\n<p>You can do that in one command</p>\n<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/main main^\n</code></pre>\n<h3>*) Adding a reason</h3>\n<p>Optionally, you can add the reason of the change to view the reason in <code>git reflog</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>$ git update-ref -m &quot;Undo an accidental commit&quot; refs/heads/main main^\n</code></pre>\n<h3>PD: Using HEAD</h3>\n<p>If <code>main</code> is your current branch, then <code>HEAD</code> is a symbolic reference to <code>refs/heads/main</code>. So you can use</p>\n<pre><code>$ git update-ref HEAD HEAD^\n</code></pre>\n<h3>PD: Undo the very first commit</h3>\n<p>If you want to delete the very first commit. You can simply delete the file <code>.git/refs/heads/main</code> (and the logs <code>.git/logs/refs/head/main</code>)  or run the following command</p>\n<pre><code>git update-ref -d refs/heads/main\n</code></pre>",
