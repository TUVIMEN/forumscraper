Hopefully, it will be released at some point.</p> <p><strong>To summarize: Epstein was put in a single cell, the guards stayed outside of the unit, and, allegedly, video footage shows nobody entered the tier where Epstein was housed. Then at 6:30 am the guards entered the tier, found Epstein dead with a noose around his neck, and triggered the alarm at 6:33 am.</strong></p> <p><strong>Given the evidence as it's known now, this is clearly a suicide.</strong></p> <p>Edit: The prison guards have admitted to falsifying records and were sentenced to probation.

Separate from the OIG’s investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP personnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal conduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s death and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not uncover evidence contradicting the FBI’s determination regarding the absence of criminality in connection with Epstein’s death.</p> </blockquote> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-bops-custody-care-and-supervision-jeffrey-epstein-metropolitan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-bops-custody-care-and-supervision-jeffrey-epstein-metropolitan</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Regarding the guards Noel and Thomas, the federal/criminal case against them <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-dismisses-case-against-jeffrey-epsteins-jail-guards-2022-01-04/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">was</a> ultimately dropped in early 2022, after they took a deferred prosecution agreement (in 2021), in which they <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/30/us/jeffrey-epstein-officers-dismissed-charges/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">agreed</a> to truthfully testify as to the circumstances of Epstein's death (and did some community service). According to Reuters:</p> <blockquote> <p>Noel and Thomas were accused of falling asleep and surfing the internet that night rather than checking on Epstein every 30 minutes, and they acknowledged having falsified records to make it seem they were monitoring Epstein properly.</p> </blockquote> <p>From earlier <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/judge-approves-deferred-prosecution-deal-for-epstein-jail-guards.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coverage</a> of the deal:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Judge] Torres, during Tuesday’s roughly 15-minute hearing, asked the guards if they understood they were admitting they “willfully and knowingly” submitted false documents about the night Epstein died.</p> <p>“Yes, your honor,” they both replied.</p> <p>Torres then told the guards, “This offers you a chance to avoid a criminal conviction.”</p> </blockquote> <p>So essentially that leaves Epstein's brother Mark and his attorneys (plus their own medical expert[s]) as contesting the cause of death. Now one could argue they did a good job in the court of public opinion, at least back in 2020 (see &quot;60 Minutes&quot; <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-jeffrey-epstein-kill-himself-60-minutes-investigates-2020-01-05/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coverage</a>, which IMHO was rather undly weighted in their favor, at least in terms of length) but <a href=\"https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88953/how-can-a-finding-of-suicide-on-the-death-certificate-by-the-office-of-chief-m\">unless</a> they win some [civil] case in which Epstein's cause of death is at stake, legally speaking the medical examiner's findings remain unimpeached.</p> <p>FWTW, the video mentioned in the other answer <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-09/video-in-apparent-epstein-suicide-attempt-is-lost-us-says\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">apparently</a> no longer exist as such:</p> <blockquote> <p>Video footage of the area around Jeffrey Epstein’s jail cell on a day he survived an apparent suicide attempt “no longer exists,” federal prosecutors told a judge Thursday.</p> <p>Officials at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York believed they had preserved footage of guards finding Jeffrey Epstein after he appeared to have attempted suicide, but actually saved a video from a different part of the jail, prosecutors said.</p> <p>The FBI also has determined that the footage does not exist on the jail’s backup video system “as a result of technical errors,” Assistant U.S. Attys. Maurene Comey and Jason Swergold wrote in a court filing.</p> </blockquote> <p>OTOH before the video vanished, AG Barr <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/no-one-entered-area-epstein-was-jailed-the-night-he-died-attorney-general-says.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a> he has personally [re]viewed it...</p> <blockquote> <p>The attorney general also sought to dampen conspiracy theories by people who have questioned whether Epstein really took his own life, saying the evidence proves Epstein killed himself. He added that he personally reviewed security footage that confirmed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed on the night he died.</p> </blockquote> <p>And apparently he <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10573985/Bill-Barr-says-surveillance-footage-proves-no-one-entered-Jeffrey-Epsteins-prison-cell.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">repeated</a> that in a later book/memoirs.</p> <blockquote> <p>'I personally reviewed that video footage. It shows conclusively that between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier,' he wrote in the book, One Damn Thing After Another.</p> </blockquote>",
