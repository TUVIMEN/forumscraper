But you want the carbonate because it is about 50% elemental Cobalt while the sulfate heptahydrate has less that 30%!! You simply dissolve the carbonate in muriatic acid until CO2 stops evolving and some excess precipitates. Filter the cobalt waste products and save them for metal extraction.

Making a nice crystalline solid, however, is not that easy. the acid tends to stick at the solid and the crystals are not nice. You can, however, easily make the anhydrous salt, by CAREFULLY heating the still acidic solution.<br /> <br /> It first becomes dark blue, then you get a dark blue syrup, when all water and excess acid have evaporated. At that point start heating at a more gentle rate. If heating is too strong, then you'll loose more HCl and then you get an oxide or oxochloride. When carefully heated, the dark blue syrup will become lighter again and at a certain point it will almost be dry. Use a glass rod to stir up the slurry (and later on: powder), until all is nice light blue. When it is almost dry and fairly powder-like, then you can increase the heating rate again, to make it really free of water. In that stage of drying there is not so much water anymore that it will hydrolyse the chloride. <br /> <br /> I've done this personally and the result is here:<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://woelen.homescience.net/science/chem/compounds/cobaltous_chloride_anh.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href); return false;\">http://woelen.homescience.net/science/chem/compounds/cobalto...</a><br /> <br /> My dry anhydrous cobalt chloride is really nice. It dissolves without leaving insoluble matter in water. Its solutions are nice pink and very pretty.<br /> <br /> Making this small amount of anhydrous cobalt chloride has taken quite some time from me. I estimate somewhere between 1.5 and 2 hours. This was mainly due to the long period of cautious drying of the dark blue syrup.<br /> <br /> [Edited on 23-4-11 by woelen]</font> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <div class=\"sig\">The art of wondering makes life worth living...<br /> Want to wonder?

Copper salts, especially of the strong acids, have a corrosive toxicity in addition to the heavy metal toxicity. Copper is phytotoxic and a fungicide.

I put excess amt of carbonate into muriatic acid until the fizzling stopped and there was a little bit of undissolved carbonate. I gravity filtered to separate the insoluble from the solution of cobalt chloride. I then placed it into a desiccator to dry. I have these crystals as you can see in the picture below. <br /> <br /> Sorry I can't seem to cut and paste my pictures. <img src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" style=\"border:none\" alt=\":(\" /> anyone know I to upload pictures?<br /> <img src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" style=\"border:none\" alt=\":(\" /><br /> <br /> I have several questions to ask: 1. why is the color so darkly purple. The cobalt chloride I purchased is much lighter in color, a bright purple. 2.

Most of what I have read about cobalt toxicity do not indicate life threatening symptoms exempt in smaal children. Copper salts, especially of the strong acids, have a corrosive toxicity in addition to the heavy metal toxicity. Copper is phytotoxic and a fungicide. I am not aware of cobalt having pesticide activity. But then again nickel is not in pesticides and I do agree they are quite toxic. </td></tr></table><font class=\"mediumtxt\"><br /> <br /> Cobalt poisoning in a 6-year-old<br /> The Lancet Vol. 335 pg. 981<br /> [Sanned - and you know what that means!]<br /> <br /> SIR—A 6-year-old boy was admitted to hospital at 1530 h on April 12, 1989. About 7 <br /> hours earlier his mother had told him to make a drink for his 4-year-old sister. He added <br /> to a blackcurrant cordial ('Ribena') half a teaspoon (about 2-5 g) of cobalt chloride <br /> crystals from a toy crystal-growing set that is widely available in UK supermarket chains <br /> (figure). His mother, suspecting that he had added something, such as soap, told him to <br /> drink it himself. He drank two-thirds of a glass at 0850 without saying what he had done <br /> and went to school. During the morning he complained of abdominal pain and vomited. <br /> The mother suspected that he might have swallowed some crystals, and the boy was <br /> taken to the local emergency department at 1300, where he was given an emetic. He <br /> vomited three times. He was transferred to the children's ward at another hospital at <br /> 1530. Physical examination was normal and cardiac monitoring revealed no <br /> abnormalities. His serum contained cobalt at 7230 nmol/1 (4020 nmol/l in whole blood); <br /> the normal range is 2-17 nmol/l for plasma and whole blood. His initial blood count was <br /> Hb 11.9 g/dI, and white cells 4900/0 (granulocytes 35%, lymphocytes 59%, monocytes <br /> 6%). Examination of the blood film confirmed neutropenia. Blood urea and electrolytes <br /> were normal. He was discharged after 48 h.<br /> <br /> [Table] Cobalt, in blood and in urine, cleared rapidly and no specific treatment for <br /> cobalt poisoning was needed.<br /> <br /> Cobalt is an essential trace element and daily intakes am 30-60 Pg (0.5-1.0 unol) in <br /> children. Cobalt salts are relatively non-toxic: and daily doses of 25-40 mg cobalt have <br /> been used in blood disorders such as the anaemia in renal failure and thalassaernia. <br /> However, prolonged treatment may cause depression of erythropoicsis, flushing, chest <br /> pain, dermatitis, tinnitus, nausea and vomiting, nerve deafness, thyroid hyperplasia, <br /> myxoedema, congestive cardiac failure, and renal damage. In this boy, who took about <br /> 2 g cobalt chloride, toxicity manifested as gastrointestinal effects and neutropenia.<br /> <br /> Jacobziner and Raybin' described a 19-month-old boy who took about 30 m! of cobalt <br /> chloride solution. He became cyanotic and died 4 h after the ingestion. Necropsy <br /> revealed little about the primary cause of death. The liver, kidneys, and spleen <br /> contained 89-4 mg cobalt. Serum cobalt levels were not measured. In 1988 Everson et <br /> al' described a 14-year-old girl who ingested about 96 mg cobalt from a chemistry set. A <br /> blood sample, 12 h after ingestion, contained 1320 nmol/I cobalt and chelation therapy <br /> was started; at 22 h her blood cobalt level was 119 nmol/l. <br /> <br /> Beer drinkers' cobalt cardiomyopathy was first noted in Quebec,[3] where 48 cases <br /> with 20 deaths were recognised. Further cases were reported from the United States <br /> and Belgium. Cobaltous sulphate had been added to the beer as a defoaming agent, <br /> and this was thought to have been mainly responsible for the acute myocardial <br /> damage,\" though nutritional factors may contribute by increasing sensitivity to cobalt <br /> toxicity. [5]<br /> <br /> Crystal-growing sets are potentially hazardous. This boy's toy also contained copper <br /> sulphate, and half a teaspoon of that would have been fatal. During preparation of this <br /> report one of us (H. T. D.) was involved in monitoring four schoolboys who ingested <br /> small amounts of copper sulphate from a chemistry set. Clearly urgent action is needed <br /> to control the use of these sets. Everson et al [2] investigated three chemistry sets, <br /> containing a total of 51 chemicals. Of 38 chemicals evaluated 66% were present in <br /> amounts that would be toxic (53%) or lethal (13%) to a 2-year-old child. Only one set <br /> had child-proof containers but for 65% of potentially toxic and all the potentially lethal <br /> chemicals first-aid instructions were provided.<br /> <br /> E. S.
