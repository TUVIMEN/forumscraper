Does anyone know anything about the system behind the homepage? Any insights would be useful, because I have absolutely no idea what triggers it or what happens. The &quot;make default page for this folder&quot; mark for the page is set correctly, even when the homepage shows up as a different page... I&#039;ve had the same homepage for 5+ years with zero issues before. Anything would be helpful, thank you!",

Is there a way to require all users who are currently registered to add a value into this profile field the next time they sign in, even if they have already registered without selecting a value?
